The initial demand was for $20k settlement plus legal fees, they sent over the actual settlement agreement template and the terms are wild beyond just the money.\nAgreement requires: bringing site into \"substantial compliance\" with wcag 2.2 level aa within the term of agreement, 24 month monitoring period where they can come back and check, if you breach any terms they can reopen the case, strict confidentiality clause so you can't even tell other business owners about the amount or terms.\nThe kicker is buried in section 4 about remediation, you have to make \"good faith efforts\" but there's no clear standard for what that means. So even after paying $20k+ and doing work, they could potentially argue you didn't try hard enough.\nI talked to a lawyer who said these agreements are designed to be vague so they can keep coming back, the confidentiality clause means most business owners can't even compare notes or warn each other.\nAnyone else seen agreements like this?

        "title": "Advice from a 9-figure entrepreneur",
        "selftext": "I started my first business in 2010, and have gone from having about a thousand bucks in my bank account to a paper net worth in the low nine figures (though this will come down to high eight figures after taxes). Here's my advice FWIW:\n\n**1. Learn technical skills.** Unless you're an artist or a restauranteur or something like that, odds are that the majority of your work is going to be done on a computer. As such, you should master keyboard shortcuts, use multiple monitors, set up your workspace in an efficient way, learn basic coding skills (Javascript, HTML, and SQL are all you really need), know how to model things out in spreadsheets, etc. These skills have been instrumental to me in everything I've done as an entrepreneur, and without them there is absolutely no way I would have succeeded. One of my earliest memories of my first business was a friend asking me how I was making money (he was trying something similar and failing); I could see that a lot of the reason he was failing is that he couldn't handle any of the technical aspects of what he was doing himself (eg building a website), and so was paying for someone else do do a third-rate job of it. I said \"learn how to code\" and he responded with \"but that's too hard.\" Yes, learning new things is hard, and he also should have learned how to code. Which brings me to...\n\n**2. Suck it up and do the hard things.** The vast majority of people give up when they hit their first wall. Another huge chunk drop off after the second, third, or fourth. The people who succeed are the ones who suck it up and power through the shitty parts of entrepreneurship (and it's mostly shitty at the start). I learned this during the first year of my third business, and I'm learning it again now as I'm trying to get my philanthropic efforts off the ground: there is just so much stuff when you're starting out that's a pain in the ass, and there's no one to do it but you. If you can muster the mental fortitude to just make yourself do those things, you will separate yourself from 99% of the competition and massively increase your odds of success. As just one example: can you even *imagine* how difficult it must have been to sell books on the internet in 1993? Jeff Bezos must have literally run into thousands of pain-in-the-ass things, any one of which would have deterred a normal person, but he kept at it and now he's Jeff Bezos.\n\n**3. That which gets measured gets improved.** I have kept a side scrolling daily spreadsheet of my company's P&L every single day going back to 2010. If I determine that something is critical to my company's success, I carefully measure it over time, and take note of any initiative that moves the numbers in a positive or negative direction. Even if you're just starting out and there's not much to measure, measure it. Make it a habit. While it's possible to drown yourself in data overload, I think it's much more common for people to be deficient in their data gathering and analysis than to take it too far.\n\n**4. Practice good manners.** It's crazy to have to write this one out, but I can't tell you how many people I come across that don't do this. If someone emails you, respond quickly. If they help you, say thank you (in fact, I recommend signing off on all your emails with \"Thanks, \\[First Name\\]\"). If they ask for a favor that's easy for you to deliver, do the favor. Follow up with people after a good conversation. Remember to always speak to what the *other person* wants, not just what you want. (That's another head-scratcher: the number of people who will say \"Hey Chris, it would really help me if you do X and Y\" without even considering what I want or whether it's in my interest to do what they're asking.)\n\n**5. Be obsessed with your business.** I recently stepped away from my company and handed the reins over to the management team. One of the major differences I've noticed in how they do things vs how I did things is that I was *obsessed* with the business, and they're not (somewhat understandably, obviously, as they don't have my equity stake in it). When you're obsessed with your business, things don't catch you by surprise because you were already worried about them way before they happened. When you're obsessed with your business, you always have a dozen ideas ready to go whenever resources free up. When you're obsessed with your business, you become the ultimate expert at the company across a variety of topics, and can be an invaluable resource to employees / teammates. Get obsessed.",

Felt like winning the lottery.18 months later, here's the math:If those 340 customers paid monthly at even 50% of normal price ($19.50), with average 14-month retention, that's $92,820 in revenue.I left $42,000 on the table. And counting, because lifetime means forever.But the money isn't the worst part.LTD customers are my highest-support users. They submit 3x more tickets than monthly subscribers. They request features constantly. They leave 1-star reviews when I don't build what they want.They have zero incentive to churn, so they stick around complaining instead of quietly leaving.My NPS among LTD customers: 12. Among monthly subscribers: 54.And I can never raise prices on them. They're grandfathered at $0/month for life.What I'd do differently:If you need cash, offer annual plans at a discount. You get money upfront but customers still renew.If you must do LTDs, cap the number ruthlessly. 50 max. Create scarcity.Never offer lifetime on a product that has ongoing server costs. You're signing up to lose money on every user forever.The AppSumo crowd isn't your target market. They're deal hunters who buy everything and use nothing. Not ideal customers for feedback or growth.Still digging out of this hole.Anyone else have LTD regrets?",

In the beginning things were rough... real rough. My first 3 months were crickets drawing my bank account down to cents.. Fast forward to the 4th month and I finally got a client. Because I was so young, my overhead was minimal so one client got me by. To not bore you will my life story, I have grown the business to \\~$1M annually without taking on any outside money. The ride has been wild and I no longer perform the actual service that we offer. I have figured out how to scale a rather unscalable business in a way that really nobody else has figured out. Here is the thing... the burnout I feel is debilitating to the point where it is hard for me to get through my days. I really used to love what it is we do and to my knowledge we are the only ones doing this at this scale without private equity or VC. All of this said, I know I am leaving TONS of $$ on the table and really no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to build what needs to be built in order to scale further. This is part of the debilitation that I feel. I have swung 40 times (thats an exaggeration) and stuck out for one reason or another. Whether it is I don't have enough money to build it or I find somebody that says they can build it and they can't. I hate the feeling of being lost or without direction and really I am starting to actually lose my damn mind. The worst part is it is only me at the top and I have nobody to really talk to about all this. Running solo in the desert trying to find rain clouds and for whatever reason I just keep finding salt flats. Advice?",

Sounds generous for a small product.\nMy math:\nAt $6K MRR growing 15% month-over-month, I'd hit $24K MRR in 12 months.\nAt 3x ARR multiple (conservative for a growing SaaS), that's an $864K valuation.\nThe $180K offer valued my 12 months of future work at negative $684K.\nBut there's more to it:\n$180K after taxes is maybe $130K.\nI'd probably have a 1-year earnout, meaning I work for them for a year.\nSo really I'm getting paid $130K to work for someone else for a year while they absorb my customers.\nI can make more than that just running my business.\nWhen to say yes to acquisition:\nYou're burned out and done.\nGrowth has stalled and you can't fix it.\nThe offer is genuinely life-changing money.\n$180K wasn't life-changing. It was a good salary for a year of my time with no equity upside.\nSaid no. They raised their offer to $240K. Still no.\nNow at $23K MRR. That $180K would've been a $500K+ mistake.\nMost early acquisition offers are designed to buy you cheap before you realize your value.\nHave you turned down acquisition offers?",
