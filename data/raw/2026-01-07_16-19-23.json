        "title": "I analyzed 9,300+ \"I wish there was an app for this\" posts on Reddit. Here is the data on what people actually want.",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a project to track \"opportunity gaps\" on Reddit—specifically posts where someone describes a pain point and asks for a tool that doesn't seem to exist.\n\nI just finished processing a dataset of 9,363 unique opportunities from the last 6 months. I wanted to share the raw trends I found because they're pretty counter-intuitive for anyone looking to build a side project or SaaS right now.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Cloud\" Trend:**\n\nAbout 7% of all requests (640+ posts) specifically asked for offline-first or privacy-focused tools. People are getting \"subscription fatigue\" and want local-only versions of popular apps (especially in productivity).\n\n**2. The Big Categories:**\n\nProductivity: 1,231 requests (The most crowded, but highest volume).\n\nEducation/Self-Improvement: 698 requests (The highest \"willingness to pay\" sentiment).\n\nBusiness Tools/SaaS: 696 requests.\n\nHealth & Wellness: 656 requests.\n\n**3. The \"ADHD\" Niche:**\n\nSurprisingly, r/ADHD is one of the highest-signal subreddits. The users there provide the most detailed \"feature requests\" because current tools often fail their specific workflows.\n\n**4. App Type Breakdown:**\n\nMobile Apps: 61%\n\nSaaS/Web Platforms: 6%\n\nDesktop/Local Software: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~2% (Small but very high intent).\n\n**5. Timing:**\n\nMost \"frustration\" posts happen on Mondays and Tuesdays. People start their work week, hit a wall with their current software, and come to Reddit to complain.\n\n**6. Where the Money Is:**\n\nThe \"Willingness to Pay\" Index\n\nI scanned the data for keywords like \"buy,\" \"price,\" \"premium,\" and \"subscription.\" While Productivity has the most requests, it does not have the most people offering to pay.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Finance (193 pay signals): By far the most profitable niche. Users are asking for specialized portfolio trackers and risk analysis tools and are explicitly looking for \"premium\" versions that handle their data securely.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Online Commerce (76 pay signals): Shopify owners and small e-commerce sellers are vocal about paying for tools that save them time on shipping, inventory, or order syncing.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Travel (42 pay signals): This is a high-intent category. People are looking for \"pro\" travel planners or specific regional transit apps and are willing to pay for the convenience of a \"working\" solution.\n\nInsight: If you want a faster path to revenue, Finance or E-commerce tools beat \"General Productivity.\"\n\n**7. The \"Pain Level\" (Frustration Score):**\n\nI measured the length and detail of the posts. Longer posts generally indicate higher frustration and a deeper \"pain point.\"\n\nThe highest frustration scores come from:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Developer Platforms (229 avg length): Developers write long, technical \"rants\" about missing features in Spark, AWS, or NetSuite. If you solve these, you have a customer for life.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Cooking & Recipes (223 avg length): Users are angry about modern recipe sites being bloated with ads and \"backstories.\" They want ultra-minimalist, high-speed tools that just show the ingredients.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Parenting (221 avg length): Parents are highly descriptive about their needs (tracking sleep, milestones, or school schedules). This is an emotional, high-retention niche.\n\nInsight: Don't just look for many posts; look for long posts. A long post is a blueprint for a feature list.\n\n**8. The \"Last 60 Days\" Trend (What's Heating Up)**\n\nLooking at the data from November to January, we can see which categories are gaining momentum right now:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Health & Wellness & Gaming: These both spiked in December/January. This follows the \"New Year, New Me\" trend. People are currently hunting for gym trackers, habit-builders, and gamified life-management tools.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Smart Home & IoT: There is a recent wave of interest in \"Data Visualization\" for smart homes—people have the sensors, but they want better graphs to see how their home’s temperature/humidity changes over time.\n\n**Summary for your \"Action Plan\":**\n\n1. High Revenue / High Volume: Build in Finance. People are screaming for better portfolio analytics.\n2. High Gratitude / Low Competition: Build for Traditional Artists (Clean-up tools) or Parents.\n3. The \"Current Wave\": Build a Minimalist Smart Home Dashboard or a Gym Decision-Fatigue Tool.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nTop Niche by Pay Signal: Finance (193 signals)\n\nTop Niche by Pain Level: Developer Platforms (High Detail)\n\nFastest Growing (Jan 2026): Health & Wellness (New Year Trend)\n\nThe \"Anti-Bloat\" Opportunity: Cooking & Recipes (Users want text-only, no ads).\n\nI built a tool (neven. app) to help me parse all this data, but I thought these high-level stats would be useful for this sub.\n\nWhich of these categories is everyone currently building in? Happy to pull more specific stats from the data if you're curious about a niche.",

Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me. The conversation had already moved. I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nCurious if others have noticed the same thing or how you handle that transition without killing the relationship.",

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post.

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

        "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nIn theory, when launching a SaaS, you validate the need first.   \n  \nIf potential clients pay, you build.   \n  \nIn practice? We all make the same rookie mistake: We start with an idea, then try to find someone to sell it to.   \n  \nIt’s usually a disaster.\n\nIn 2023, I did exactly that. \n\nActually, I did worse. \n\nI copied someone else’s idea for my market without knowing if it would work.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nIt's 2023. I’m new to SaaS, naive, and I think \"YCombinator model = Guaranteed Success.\"    \n  \nI  spot a company called OneText. They do \"text-to-buy\" for e-commerce in the USA. \n\nI think: \"Let's bring this to Europe! But with WhatsApp.\"\n\nI spend 6 months building a clone. \n\nResult? We launch the MVP. Nobody wants it. \n\nNOBODY.   \n  \nEurope wasn't ready for text-based purchasing. \n\nA total zero. 6 months of work thrown in the trash.\n\n\n\nSo, I pivot. \n\nNew logic: \"Let's find companies already selling WhatsApp tools in Europe making real money, and just copy them.\" \n\nI find Shopify apps making $2-3M. \n\nNot a creative idea but at least there is a market.\n\nWe clone the MVP features in 2 weeks. I try to sell it... and miracle. \n\nClients. Happy clients. Retention.\n\nIn 6 months, we grew from $0 to $50k MRR almost exclusively through cold outreach.\n\n\n\nWe had no vision. We didn't love the project, and we didn't know how to innovate. \n\nSo, we contacted buyers and sold the SaaS for 7 figures in just a few weeks. \n\n(This was early 2025).\n\n[Here is the SaaS I sold and the proof](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremyhorowitz1_after-45-yrs-352-deals-5-lost-lois-i-activity-7297946777532391424-x-zZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6Qr-cBuSULRKCL1d1JL7e1LIgV7c6UZ3c) \n\n\n\nA few months ago, I launched a new SaaS. This time, before writing ONE LINE of code, I sold the solution using a PowerPoint deck. We hit $7k MRR before coding a single feature. \n\nToday, we are over $30k/month.\n\nThe lesson: Don't waste time. SELL BEFORE YOU CODE.\n\nDon't be a donkey like I was and waste 6 months of your life.\n\n\n\nBTW, [here is what I’m building now](https://gojiberry.ai) (I hope we will reach $1m ARR very soon) \n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "Hi all- I was doing our new yearly planning for our business and I was looking to start investing in other marketing channels this year! Most of our customers come via Google ads and we never really invested in marketing otherwise! \n\nSo curious, if you run a successful business, what marketing channels actually bring you customers? Would be great if you can mention your industry as well since that's quiet relevant! For some additional context we are a B2B business selling to companies in United States!   \n",
