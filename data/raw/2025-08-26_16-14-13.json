        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

We‚Äôve done really well but now the hiring strategy is changing. The focus is now on bringing in people with 10+ years of experience in each little section of our project.

Amazing products died because nobody knew they existed.\n3. **Co-founder drama:** Misaligned goals, burnout, or trust issues killed startups faster than bad code ever could.\n4. **Pricing mistakes:** Either undercharging (unsustainable) or overcharging (no adoption). Pricing experiments came too late.\n5. **Burning out:** Many founders just ran out of energy (or money) before they found traction. Persistence mattered more than brilliance.\n\n**Takeaway for me as a bootstrapper:**  \nIt‚Äôs not just about *what* you build. It‚Äôs about *why*, *for who*, and whether you can actually reach them without running yourself into the ground.\n\nCurious: If you‚Äôve failed at a project before, which of these was the killer?

I quit my comfortable job, rented an office, built a small team, and spent $2,500 setting up what I thought was a real business.\n\nWe built and polished our product, held energetic team meetings, and set roadmap after roadmap. The result?¬†**$0 revenue, and not a single real customer.**  \nLooking back: I had completely underestimated the challenge of¬†*distribution*. We could build‚Äîbut without an audience, nobody cared.\n\nInstead of trying to add yet another feature, I decided to switch gears and document my journey publicly, sharing raw, honest updates and lessons on Instagram and YouTube.\n\n**The results in just 20 days:**\n\n* **200,000 views**¬†across platforms\n* **1,000+ followers**¬†interested in our space\n* Actual leads reaching out for conversations\n* Unexpected support and feedback from the community\n\n**Hard-earned lessons:**\n\n* Building in silence = building for yourself\n* Audience-first wins: Start with distribution, not just product\n* Content compounds; even imperfect stories beat polished demos\n* Feedback from just a few real users teaches more than months at the whiteboard\n\nNow, I‚Äôm focused almost entirely on building¬†*with*¬†my audience, sharing what works and what doesn‚Äôt in real time.\n\n**Would love to hear from other founders:**\n\n* Have you struggled with getting attention for your product despite building something good?\n* What‚Äôs worked in terms of getting your first loyal users?\n* Any tips on growing beyond the first few hundred engaged followers?\n\nNot promoting here‚Äîjust want to share what worked (and didn‚Äôt) for me. I genuinely hope this helps anyone feeling stuck at zero. If you‚Äôre building something similar, let‚Äôs swap notes in the comments!",
