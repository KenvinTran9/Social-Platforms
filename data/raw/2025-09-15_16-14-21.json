Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything.",

Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",

Nothing new and it’s sometimes blatant like the whole Oracle thing with OpenAI.\n\nTech billionaires are making money and getting lots of capital from equity markets, collaborating to increase ai hype. That capital is funding all r&d, in house or via the ai startup ecosystem. When ai doesn’t live up to the hype, it will become more clear that there was massive over speculation (“AGI IN 2 YEARS GUISE!!”) and the funding well will dry.\n",

It was marketed as a way to scale to $10k–$30k months, with support, strategy, and structure. But there’s no real curriculum. The program includes: \n\n\t•\t2 monthly Q&A calls\n\t•\t1 monthly workshop (often irrelevant)\n\t•\tA Slack group that’s fairly quiet \n\t•\tA video library that’s quite basic \n\nIt feels like I paid thousands to be able to ask the coach questions, but I don’t even know what to ask. \n\nI signed a contract and the payments go through Stripe automatically. The contract says if I stop paying I will lose access and I’ll be liable for attorney / collection fees. We live in different countries (North America/Europe) so I’m not sure she would really pursue me internationally and consumer protection laws are quite strong here. I do feel like I kinda got scammed. \n\nWould you stop paying and risk it? Try to negotiate an early exit? Talk to the coach?
