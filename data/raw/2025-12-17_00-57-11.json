        "selftext": "I dont think anyone really talks about how quiet entrepreneurship can feel once the initial excitement wears off. At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved from rollingriches that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

        "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",
