Last night as I was playing with my toy trains in my mom’s basement I came up with the idea of not just another service, or an agent for the sake of an agent but a truly in-demand service. Took a two hour break from scrolling Reddit, watched an 5 minute intro to HTML & CSS tutorial and coded the most brilliant software ever created (to-do app that saves to localStorage).\n\nAn hour later and I have over 100 million visits (DDoS attack) which is truly unimaginable growth, I never expected my product to catch on THIS fast. Also, I received a call from a huge company (Indian customer service I think that tells you all you need to know ;) ) about buying my app for $1.5 billion and a contract that includes free use of the company’s private jet, private island, mansion and more.\n\nI instantly accepted their offer, gave the my mom’s credit card number and internet banking password and am currently waiting for the money to come in. To say it's a it career speedrun is an understatement :) my relatives don't know (my mom has no idea lol), real-life gf non existent. Only my imaginary furry girlfriend knows because I tell her everything (she makes me, otherwise I get punished).\n\nThere is no point in advertising anything anymore, so I will answer your questions as best as I can while waiting for my money to come in. \n\nThe most important thing to know is that luck is, of course, very important, but the most important thing is your ideas.\n\n>I will be answering your questions but I’m closing the AMA because my mom says she wants to have a talk (she must be so proud and happy!!)",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing? Do I just roll with it or am I overthinking this",

We signed a few big clients, hired more people, and for the first time, we’re actually profitable. But now it feels like we’ve hit a new kind of chaos. Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we’d been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn’t realize they were using the same thing. We’re not “corporate” enough to hire a CFO, but I’m spending way too much time trying to figure out where money’s going. I’ve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging? Is there a system that actually works for small but growing teams?",

She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",
