My dad told me to stop programming simple games and create something useful, so i took his advice.\n\nI contacted a local clothing brand that was having trouble with their catalog photos. They wanted professional-looking photos of models but didn't have the budget for a photoshoot.\n\nWhat i built:\n\nI wrote a Python script that takes the flat images of their products and runs them through an AI workflow (generating variations, scaling to 4K, removing watermarks). It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business. He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before. My questions for experienced entrepreneurs:\n\n1. Is it a bad idea to accept an advance when I'm still learning?\n2. For those automating businesses: What are the safest and lowest-risk automations\n\ni\n\n1. should propose first so\n\ni\n\n1. don't accidentally ruin their business?\n2. How do you deal with \"imposter syndrome\"? I feel like I got lucky with the first question.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "Reply-all disaster. Customer complained about a bug. Support agent responded internally with\r\nnotes about the issue plus some candid commentary about how we needed to fix it faster.\r\nAccidentally sent it to the customer instead of just the team.\r\nMy stomach dropped when I saw it. The internal notes were honest in ways we'd never be\r\ndirectly with a customer. Criticism of our own response time. Acknowledgment that this had\r\nhappened before. Real talk about priorities.\r\nCalled the customer expecting damage control.\r\nHis response surprised me. \"That's the most honest communication I've ever gotten from a\r\nvendor. Most companies pretend problems don't exist. You're clearly taking this seriously\r\ninternally.\"\r\nHe became an advocate. Referred us to three other companies. Wrote a case study. All\r\nbecause he accidentally saw how we really talked about serving him.\r\nTransparency, even accidental, builds trust that polish never can.",
