        "selftext": "I went down a rabbit hole on a firm called Vy Capital, and the deeper you look, the more surprising it gets. They operate with almost no visibility in the tech world, yet they’ve become one of Elon Musk’s biggest financial backers.\n\nWhat shocked me first was how small they are.\n\nVy runs with only four core investors and roughly twenty people across California, London and Dubai. Even with a team that small, they **manage around fifteen billion dollars and have delivered about twenty-eight per cent annual returns for ten years.**\n\nThe second surprising thing is how concentrated they are. Instead of spraying money across dozens of startups, they built their entire identity around backing Musk early and sticking with him for the long haul.\n\nSome of their biggest moves include:\n\n* Investing in SpaceX when it was valued at $15B (it’s now close to $400B)\n* Putting $700M into the Twitter acquisition\n* Taking large positions in Neuralink and xAI\n\nThere are estimates that more than half of Vy’s portfolio is now tied to companies Musk runs.\n\nThe final thing that stood out is how they think about building a firm. They aren’t trying to scale into a giant institution. They actually told their LPs recently that they won’t raise outside money anymore. After compounding billions, they want to invest their own capital instead, which is extremely rare in venture.\n\nAnd they’re not only focused on the US. They backed companies like Zomato and Urban Company in India, along with firms like Upgrade, Cerebras and Coalition.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Vy feels less like a traditional VC fund and more like a tight, high-trust investment group built around long-term conviction instead of chasing trends. Small team, deep focus, long holding periods and quiet execution.\n\nPretty unusual in today’s tech investment world.",

        "selftext": "I run a small performance design studio and things are usually steady enough. Over the summer I picked up this new client who ended up becoming a pretty big part of my revenue. We were working on the branding stuff for his new business, the early stage bits, figuring out the look and feel and how he wanted the whole thing to show up.\n\nThen bad luck hit. I got slammed with this severe liver inflammation thing. The doctor told me to stay in bed for 2–3 weeks and cut my workload down so I could actually rest. I was upfront with my client about it, and he was super cool. I even managed to send small updates here and there so the project didn’t stall completely..\n\nBut after a point he just stopped replying. No “hey I need a break,” no “I’m rethinking things,” nothing. Two weeks go by. Nothing. I figured he was busy, but after the third week of being left on read, it hit me that the guy I thought was a long-term partner had just ghosted me without a word .\n\nFast forward to last week, I was scrolling through a business subreddit and saw a familiar brand name on my feed. It was him. He was asking for advice on his DIY branding and positioning assets he generated using some online tool. The stuff he posted was nothing like what he first told me he wanted. It honestly felt like he’d gone in the opposite direction overnight.\n\nTurns out some clients don’t tell you what’s bothering them. They’d rather ask the internet than have a simple five minute conversation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this or am I just catching weird luck lately ?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Instead, there are lots of new Q&A / discussion-based startups appearing, and even older platforms like Reddit feel far more active, relevant, and alive.\n\nIt makes me wonder: what really happened to Quora as a product and company? Did the experience slowly get worse (bots, low-quality answers, clickbait, aggressive ads), or did user behavior simply shift toward faster, community-driven platforms and AI tools?\n\nFrom a startup point of view, I’m fascinated by how a small team can compete with – and sometimes beat – a big, established player. With fewer resources but more focus, a startup can ship faster, keep the UX clean, moderate better, and stay closer to what users want *right now*, not what worked 10 years ago.\n\nFor founders and PMs here:\n\n* If you were building in the “Quora space” today, what would you do differently?\n* What do you think Quora got wrong (or stopped doing right)?\n* Are Q&A platforms still a good problem space in 2025, or is that window mostly closed?\n\n(For clarity: I’m not promoting anything, just trying to understand the dynamics and learn from Quora’s trajectory.)",
