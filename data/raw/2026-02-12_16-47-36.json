        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

And looking back at my client list, there's a clear line between the ones who went to zero and the ones who actually made money.\n\nThe ones who won? They were terrible \"product managers\" in the traditional sense.\n\nHere is what the successful founders did that the failed ones didn't:\n\n1. They launched incomplete.\nThe winners forced me to ship half-baked features. They didn't care if the \"Settings\" page was empty. They didn't care if the password reset flow was \"email me and I'll do it manually.\" They just wanted the core value prop live. The failures? They delayed for 3 weeks because the mobile menu animation wasn't smooth.\n\n2. They treated me like a partner, not a printer.\nThe failed founders sent me a 20-page PDF and said \"build this.\" The successful ones got on a call and said \"here is the problem, how can we solve this cheaply?\" They let me cut scope. They let me tell them that their idea was expensive and stupid. They wanted friction.\n\n3. They focused on one feature.\nI had a client who built a massive project management tool. It failed. Too many buttons. Another client built a tool that just did *one specific type of invoice reconciliation* for dentists. He's rich now. The winners don't build platforms. They build tools that solve a bleeding neck problem.\n\n4. They ignored the tech stack.\nThe failures asked me \"Are we using Next.js 14? Is it serverless?\" The winners asked \"Can we add Stripe by Friday?\" They didn't care if I built it in PHP or Python. They cared about the cash register ringing.\n\nIf you are a non-technical founder, stop trying to play CTO. Stop obsessing over the architecture.\n\nFocus on the problem. Be willing to ship something ugly. And find a developer who will tell you \"no\" when you ask for stupid features.\n\nThat's the pattern. It's not magic. It's just brutal prioritization.\n\nAnyone else notice this split in their clients?\n\n",

        "selftext": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice & clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

        "selftext": "We have a team of about 35 people and sales were going pretty well. One rep in particular was crushing it, consistently hitting 150% of quota, closing deals the rest of the team couldn't. When we decided we needed a sales manager, promoting him felt obvious. He knew our product, clients really loved him, and the team respected him.\n\nThree months in and everything was falling apart. The other reps were frustrated because he couldn't explain what he did differently; he just \"knew\" when a deal would close. Pipeline reviews were useless, he'd say things like \"this one feels good\" instead of actually coaching them. Two people from our team quit because they said they weren't learning anything. The worst part was that he was miserable, too. He missed selling and hated the administrative stuff.\n\nWe ended up moving him back to sales and hiring an actual sales leader from outside. Someone who'd built processes before, knew how to train people, and could look at data and spot patterns. It costed us about six months of momentum and probably $100K in lost deals while everyone was confused about who was running what.\n\nThe lesson for me was that your best performer is rarely your best manager. Those are completely two different skill sets. I wish I'd just hired someone with management experience from the start instead of assuming \"good at sales\" meant \"good at leading sales.\" Live and learn, I guess.\n\nHas anyone else made this mistake, or just us?",

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",
