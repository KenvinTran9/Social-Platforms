Total: $4,300.\n\nFirst year income: 32 rentals at 300-500 dollars (according to the duration of the event and travel distance). Total revenue: $12,400.\n\nExpenses: \nInsurance cost: 800 a year, equipment maintenance cost: 200, fuel/travel cost: 600, storage cost: 0 (garage used) and marketing cost: 400. Total expenses: $2,000.\n\nNet profit year one: $10,400 less start up of 4300 = actual profit of 6100.\n\nMarket reality: It is a seasonal market (spring/summer heavy), the corporate events are better paying than birthday parties, repeat clients are hard to come by, marketing is an ongoing undertaking.\n\nLessons learned: Niche event equipment has reduced competition but reduced market. You are not making money but it is a good side business. Quality of equipment is an issue - malfunctions cost bookings.\n\nScaling potential: Has an opportunity to add additional unique equipment to provide package deals. A single-item rental business is not one that can grow without an expansion.\n\nIs it worth it? As a side business, yes. Although it is the prime income, most likely, not until you scale.",

        "selftext": "I've been wanting to leave my corporate job for a while now and do something more hands-on. My wife and I were on vacation last month playing mini golf with the kids, and I had this random thought - I wonder what it actually costs to own one of these places.\r\n\r\nI started researching when I got home and went down a serious rabbit hole. Turns out mini golf course for sale pop up regularly, especially older mom-and-pop operations where the owners are retiring. The listings are all over the place though - some want $500k for a full setup with land, others are just selling the equipment and obstacles for way less.\r\n\r\nThe real eye-opener was learning about startup costs if you wanted to build from scratch. You're looking at easily $100k-300k depending on the size, and that's before you factor the land, permits, insurance, all the boring stuff. Even used obstacles and equipment aren't cheap when you need 18 holes worth.\r\n\r\nI spent weeks looking at everything - franchise opportunities, independent courses, even what it would cost to buy obstacles separately and piece something together. I found some interesting options through commercial equipment suppliers, auction sites, and even saw mini golf course equipment on wholesale platforms like Alibaba while I was comparing prices internationally.\r\n\r\nHaven't pulled the trigger on anything obviously, but I am genuinely surprised by how much goes into these businesses. Seasonal revenue in most places, maintenance cost, competition from other entertainment options. It's not the simple passive income situation I imagined.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here actually own or run something like this? Is it as much work as it seems, or am I overthinking it ?\r",

        "selftext": "\nHi team,\n\nI’ve been working on my startup as a side hustle alongside my university educated day job for 10 years now. The R&D has certainly come a long way bootstrapping the whole time. I’ve been scared to take any investment because I knew that I could bootstrap that little bit longer and as a result give away less equity the further along I got it. But it’s come at a cost I didn’t think about 10 years ago, I’ve swapped gained equity for life time. \n\nI feel so behind compared to my friends and family members of similar age who are all marked with children. I had a relationship for 8 years of the startup’s life and 2 years ago it all got too much and we separated. She wanted to move forward and I just couldn’t commit to having kids before the R&D was earning revenue. When I first started the startup at 24 I thought ‘I’ll be a millionaire in a few years’. It’s not about the money specifically, it’s about the financial security of being able to do something I love rather than the day job that I don’t love. But here we are now I’m 36 and single and I feel ashamed going on dates and admitting that I don’t have a house or a nice car (which would normally be associated with my day job). I’ve attached the idea of success in the startup to my def worth as a person. Deep down I think I’ve had the belief that I need the startup to succeed in order to be loveable - even to those that admit they love me because I was/am under the illusion I need to be successful before anyone could see me and was/am too ashamed at my position relative to where I thought I would be. \n\nI should add: the startup is in the biology and material science field. It takes a long time to grow things but the IP developed along the way compounds, it’s a little different to a software startup. \n\nTL;DR: The R&D is certainly close to investment level and I can’t stop, I just feel behind, embarrassed and ashamed at where I am compared to where I thought I would be at this point in life. I’m sure so many of you can relate - I’d love to hear your experiences to just help me realise I’m not a loser or alone and that it’s all going to be ok. For anyone else who needs to hear this: you’re not alone, I’m right hear with you and I hope it’ll all work out for us. \n\nMy takeaway/what I've learnt: James Dyson has been a major role model for me. I've always wanted to operate like him and be successful without external funding but we're not all James Dyson and have a product as revolutionary as that. I am learning to accept that 100% of 0 is still 0. It's better to own part of a million/billion dollar company than to own all of a worthless company. Time to ask for help.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
