I knew absolutely nothing about Swift, databases, or app development.\n\n**The Problem:** My girlfriend and I had this recurring issue: We would send each other 100+ TikToks/Reels of \"Must Visit Places\" or \"Cute Date Ideas.\" But when the weekend actually came, we’d forget everything. The links were buried under thousands of \"Good morning\" texts and stickers. We ended up going to the same old mall every time.\n\n**The Solution:** I decided to build a solution. I utilized AI tools and learned on the fly to build **WeDo: Couple Bucket List**. It’s a simple app where you \"Share\" a link from TikTok/IG directly to the app, and it organizes them into a Bucket List & Map.\n\n**The Result:** I launched it quietly. Ran some small experimental ads on TikTok and posted some content. To my surprise, it resonated. A video went viral locally, and today I woke up to find my app sitting at **#20 in the Lifestyle Category** (right next to Pinterest and Tinder in my country).\n\nIt’s surreal seeing my little project charting against billion-dollar companies.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Flutter/Dart for cross-platform (iOS & Android), Firebase (Firestore + Cloud Functions) for backend, Swift & Kotlin for native Share Extensions, Python for content scraping automation.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions about the marketing or the \"non-technical\" journey!",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

        "selftext": "I joined a very small startup recently - basically a 3-person team inside a slightly larger group of sister companies. When I accepted the role, I was clearly told:\n\nI’m effectively employee #2 in this branch/ startup\n\nIt’s a flat structure\n\nI report to the COO (of the whole group of companies)\n\nMy work would span product-ish stuff, operations, and building internal systems\n\nThere’s room to grow into more product responsibilities\n\nThis is exactly the kind of hybrid role I wanted, and I’ve been delivering. I adapt fast, the work suits me, and I enjoy being close to both building and operations.\n\nBut… something is off.\n\nThe other guy on the team (I’ll call him X) has started behaving like he’s my manager, even though nobody ever said that and it directly contradicts what I was told.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* In group conversations (internal or external), he talks over me or completely ignores what I say.\n* He hijacks meetings I am having with other stake-holders and schedules the follow ups with himself. The worst part is it's not his domain/ expertise or even related to him.\n* When I reach out for quick clarifications, I often get stonewalled or made to wait, even for simple yes/no things. It's this weird power trip in situations where I can see he is just scrolling on his phone.\n* If I raise concerns or offer ideas, he tends to dismiss them until someone else validates the same point.\n* He has this subtle but constant need to assert control over decisions, process, and communication. \n\nIt’s not a personality clash. It’s an odd, unspoken power dynamic that appeared out of nowhere. And now it’s starting to affect workflow because I can’t move fast if another person keeps acting like I need his approval for everything.\n\nMy issue isn’t authority or ego. I genuinely don’t care about titles. I just want clarity so things don’t bottleneck and so the environment doesn’t get toxic. There was supposed to be transparency, autonomy, and collaboration, not this kind of shadow hierarchy.\n\nI like the COO (my actual manager) and trust him, but I’m struggling with how to bring this up without sounding like I’m complaining about a co-worker. I want to frame it as: “This dynamic is slowing our execution. Can we align on structure and expectations?”\n\nFor anyone who’s worked in tiny startups or flat teams:\n\nIs this kind of power struggle normal when roles aren’t clearly defined?\n\nAnd how do you bring this up with leadership without sounding political?\n\nAny advice would help. It's uncomfortable navigating a structure that says it’s flat, but feels like there's an invisible hierarchy someone invented on their own.",
