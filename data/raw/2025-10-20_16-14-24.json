        "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them.

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI joined a Series-A startup recently as a tech lead. On paper, the vision sounded amazing. It's  a super-flexible platform meant to work for any company, in any industry.\n\nThe pay is good and the people are nice. \n\nBut two weeks in, here’s what I’m seeing:\n\n1. Trying to do everything:\nThe founders want to build something that works for everyone, across every possible use case. There’s no clear niche or focus. Just “we’ll handle all kinds of clients.”\n\n\n2. Product constantly breaking:\nThey trying to bring all in one app. The system works with few demos, but when setup or real customer data is in progress, it breaks. Every new customer is unique in their requirements, and instead of saying no or prioritizing, the team feels compelled to make it bespoke which ruins other parts of the product.\n\n3. Fragile technical foundation:\nManagement is very non-technical. There's constant pressure from sales to \"just make it work.\" Many clients pay less than 1000 dollars but every single one demands high-touch service. (Its more VC money than customer revenue)\n\n4. Burnout and team fatigue:\nThere have already been some people who've left. The ones remaining all appear to be exhausted (and annoyed). Most dev work is outsourced to contractors and have 4 or 5 engineers in office. They are aggressively hiring without any plan. \n\n5. No actual forward progress:\nEvery week is a new fire drill. New clients come in, something breaks, quick fix, another feature breaks and it goes on. They rely on vibe code shortcuts and one-off hacks, so debugging and ownership are very difficult. \n\n\n\nI’ve been here barely two weeks, and people are already holding me accountable for issues that have existed for months.\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\n1) Is this kind of chaos normal for a Series-A startup?\n\n2) Has anyone ever witnessed a horizontal \"serve-everyone\" product plan come to reality?\n\n3) If you were standing in my position, would you stick around to try to steer it or cut losses early before getting dragged down with it?\n\nWould really appreciate some honest thoughts from people who have been in this position.\n\n(I will not promote)\n",
