        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope you’re doing well.   \n  \nI booked three influencers to promote [my SaaS](http://gojiberry.ai) on LinkedIn, and here are the results.  \n  \n You’ve probably already seen my previous posts. Last time, [I booked five](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1or644h/i_paid_5_influencers_on_linkedin_to_promote_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and three of them were completely fake, meaning they were using pods.   \n  \nBased on that experience with the five influencers, I rebooked three.   \n  \nThe one who performed the best last time was in the French-speaking market, so I thought, why not take three people in the French-speaking market this time?\n\nSo I picked three people, budget was 500 dollars per post, for a total of 1,500 dollars.\n\n**How did I find them?** It’s very simple.   \n  \nCompetition on LinkedIn is extremely low.   \n  \nThere are people with audiences worth far more than Instagram or TikTok influencers, because it's B2B and the audience actually has budget.   \n  \nBut since there isn’t huge demand, they’re willing to post for 500 dollars.   \n  \nAnd if you think about it, 500 dollars is five months of someone at 100 dollars per month. Or even one month at 500 dollars. It can be profitable very quickly. For high-ticket products worth several thousand euros per month, it’s almost impossible not to break even.   \n  \nYou just need a few demos, close one client, and you’re good.\n\n**How did I contact them?**   \n  \nI looked at the French influencer who had performed the best last time.   \nI checked who interacted with him the most and who had an audience among those people.\n\n  \nI reached out by sending the post from the previous campaign and said, “We did this promotion with this person, would you be interested?” We agreed on a price, and we were on.\n\nA few things to mention. \n\nMy process is always the same.\n\nI want a post that goes viral, with people commenting a specific keyword. \n\nWhen people comment that keyword, I want the influencer to reply with a link to a Notion document.   \n  \n**Why do we do this instead of directly talking about my tool?**   \n  \nSimply to maximize reach. When I hire a LinkedIn influencer, the goal is to get as many impressions as possible, as many comments as possible, and as many clicks as possible on the links in the comments. \n\n  \nThen the Notion document is basically a blueprint explaining how to implement what was said in the post. And of course, to implement what’s in the post, at some point they will need to click on my SaaS and create a free account.\n\nIt’s a big mistake I see most brands making.   \n  \nI see PipeDrive, I see Canva booking influencers, and no one puts the link in the comments.   \n  \nPeople are lazy. If it’s not a direct click, few people will copy your brand name and search for it.   \nUnless you’re doing brand awareness with a huge budget and you don’t care about conversion, you must put the link directly in the comments.\n\nThen, **how do I make sure influencers actually do the work?**   \n  \nI write the post for them, get it validated, create the Notion resource with dedicated tracking links, and I push them all day to reply to comments.   \n  \nThis is extremely important, because if they don’t do it, it’s basically wasted money.\n\nI booked three influencers, each with their own Notion document.   \n  \nSame content, but different links and images. I wrote the posts, and then they published them on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\nAnother thing you can do:   \n  \nif an influencer is too expensive, negotiate. And if they won’t lower the price, negotiate multiple posts, or ask if they have a newsletter, a YouTube channel, etc. Try to compensate the price difference with extra value. Most of the time, it’s more about price than value. If the influencer says 600 euros, it means he wants 600 euros. But doing one post or two for 600 euros isn’t a huge difference. Negotiate this way, it’s important.\n\nNow for the results.   \n  \nThese three influencers brought a total of 58 trials to my SaaS.  \n  \nOn average, we convert at 30%.   \n  \nThat means around 16 or 17 customers.   \n  \nThat’s 1,600 to 1,700 dollars in MRR. We’ll see if the trial-to-paid conversion matches our usual numbers, but it’s extremely promising.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the influencer who performed the best last time performed the worst this time because his post completely flopped.   \n  \nStill, he remains profitable. The results are very good. It brought thousands of people to the Notion resource, hundreds of people to my website, and again, 58 people added their card, with around 30% converting.\n\nOn top of that, we know posts continue to live over time. They will keep bringing trials. All the people who didn’t start a trial but saw the resource will see us again later and think, “I’ve seen this tool before,” which makes conversion easier.\n\nSo yes, it’s extremely profitable. \n\n[Here are the posts the influencers made ](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-influencer-campaign-11-20-2025-2b1b9abcbe3f80c5b619d225a6d64b6a?source=copy_link)\n\nThanks everyone, bye!",

Some things can just be useful and make beer money.\n\nAnyone else build something stupid that accidentally makes money?",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

I'm the only developer, the only support person, the only marketer, the only salesperson. Every customer email feels like homework I don't want to do. Every bug feels personal. Every churn notification ruins my day. I started this because I wanted freedom. Instead, I built myself a job I can't quit. The Breaking Point Yesterday a customer asked for a feature that would take me 2 weeks to build. Another customer threatened to churn if I didn't add SSO this month. My payment processor flagged 3 accounts for review. And my girlfriend asked when I'm going to stop working at 11pm every night. The answer is never. Because if I stop, the whole thing collapses. I know what people will say: \"Hire someone!\" But hiring means giving up profit margin, dealing with management I've never done, and trusting someone else with my codebase. That sounds worse than the current situation. \"Sell it!\" To who? This is too small for acquirers and too dependent on me to fetch a real multiple. \"Just push through!\" For what? More money I don't have time to spend? Another year of 80-hour weeks? The Honest Truth I'm starting to think profitable isn't the same as worth it. Maybe I'd rather make $5K/month doing something I actually enjoy than $8K doing something that makes me miserable. Or maybe I'm just burned out and need a break. I don't even know anymore.

Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want him out, but they are not buying his shares, so he cannot leave.\n\nHe is stuck inside a company he started. It honestly sounds brutal. Almost like he never really learned how venture works until it was too late.\n\nStories like this remind me why I am bootstrapping my own project. No outside pressure, no board calls, no one ready to pull the rug out. I get to actually enjoy what I am building, set my own pace, and keep control. Sometimes I wonder if more founders would choose this way if they heard about the real tradeoffs up front.",
