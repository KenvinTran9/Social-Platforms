        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

My hourly rate makes it possible for me to pay my bills, but I am by no means enjoying a luxurious life myself.  By contrast, my busy seasons make it possible for me to survive my slow seasons.\n\nWhen you have a potential client decline working with you and gripe about the price, how do you respond?  In the past, I've responded with grace, i.e. \"No worries, thanks for reaching out!\"\n\nBut these folks stick with me.  They're reaching out about a service that is, by its very nature, a luxury offering; the clients who have complained about my prices live in the most expensive New York City neighborhoods (West Village, Upper West Side, Chelsea, where a 2 bedroom will put you back $7,000/month or more). I've noticed a direct relationship between people who want all-organic ingredients or line-caught salmon, and then complain about my rates.\n\nI was thinking of saying, \"Thanks for letting me know.  My rate is competitive among New York City personal chefs, and makes it possible for me to live within delivering distance of my clients.\"  But I wonder if it's classier to not go there.\n\n",

Over the past few months, I've watched more than 1000 founders launch their products on my site.\n\nThere's a pattern I see over and over:\n\nMonth 1-6: Build incredible product  \nMonth 7: Launch to 12 users  \nMonth 8: \"Maybe I need more features?\"  \nMonth 12: Still struggling to get customers... -> panic\n\nThere's a common theme here. Almost everyone can build beautiful (and mostly effective) SaaS projects.\n\nThe mistake most founders make is thinking the building phase is the hardest part. It's not. Getting customers is.\n\nMost founders have no systematic approach of getting customers. They try random stuff, post around on product hunt, twitter but that's where they are wrong. Most B2B customers are not in the \"build in public\" or \"tech founders\" circles. They're employees at companies doing their jobs.\n\nSo I'm building  something called the \"Customer Engine\", a system that gives exact daily tasks for B2B SaaS founders to get their first customers. No more guessing what to do each day.\n\nInstead of: \"Should I cold email or try LinkedIn today?\". You get: \"Send 8 LinkedIn requests to marketing managers using template #3\". Plus a community where founders share what actually works (with real numbers). And the tasks are personalized to your buyer type and pricing model.\n\nWould love your thoughts on this. Would you use something like this? What would make this most valuable for you?\n\nWaitlist: [customerengine.co](http://customerengine.co)",

        "selftext": "I’ve been experimenting with flipping small stuff arbitrage and honestly the hardest part isn’t finding items it’s missing out on the good deals. Most days it feels like a signal vs. noise thing. By the time I check shipping, condition, seller reliability someone else already bought it. Right now I'm using saved searches, spreadsheets, and alerts. It works but im open to know other systems? I keep seeing other buyers who seem to be killing it like they’ve figured out ways to do it or just decide quicker.",
