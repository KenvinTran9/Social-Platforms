        "selftext": "Saw a post earlier today about how lonely the founder‚Äôs path really is. I dropped a long reply there, but this topic hit me so deep I felt it deserved its own thread.\n\nHere‚Äôs the truth nobody hypes on LinkedIn:\n\nStarting a company is like breaking out of prison. The 9 to 5 cage feels safe through steady paycheck, social life, weekends off. But when you escape, you enter a world that‚Äôs free but brutal. Freedom comes with wounds, sacrifices, and nights when it‚Äôs just you and your doubts.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù, it‚Äôs being alone in your thoughts. Your friends don‚Äôt get it, family nods politely, and even co-workers (if you have any) aren‚Äôt lying awake thinking about cash flow and churn. You carry that mental weight solo.\n\nThen come the sacrifices:\n\nFinancial ‚Üí You go from spending freely to questioning every expense.\n\nRejection ‚Üí Months of work, 50+ investor rejections, endless pivots.\n\nBias ‚Üí Judged on your passport, accent, gender, even your postcode.\n\nSide hustles ‚Üí Odd jobs, freelancing, hustling just to survive.\n\nBut you‚Äôre not actually alone. Many before you walked this road, and what waits at the end of the tunnel is worth it:\n\n1. Family that stood by you\n\n2. Financial freedom\n\n3. Physical freedom\n\n4. A transformed mindset\n\nAt that point, you realize what you really gave up was just time, a fraction of what you wasted in the cage.\n\nüí° TL;DR: Entrepreneurship is dark, lonely, and brutal, but you‚Äôre not the only one walking this road. The pain is the price of freedom.\n\nStay blessed, fellow founders. Shout out if you need someone who‚Äôs been there, plenty of us are carrying candles along the path.",

        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed ‚Äî and I‚Äôm done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "title": "Here‚Äôs how I got +11,000 downloads & 631 sales for my study app",
        "selftext": "First and fore most the app is freemium so that‚Äôs why only 631 sales ($7.99/mo or $39.99/year. I have yet to figure out proper monetization and better ways to get the free users to actually pay but students are notoriously broke lol\n\nIm a young female founder so I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs lots of things I should be doing that I‚Äôm not :) any advice is welcome. Oh also sorry for any tangents I have severe adhd so yeah.\n\nHere is what DIDN‚ÄôT work:\n\nX. Agencies. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but 3 out of 4 totally screwed me. Seems their business model is broken or idek. It seems it‚Äôs mostly just management fees and then outsourcing my work overseas for pennies on the dollar. Only one agency produced a profit for me but even then it wasn‚Äôt substantial enough for me to continue at this stage as it was barely above breaking even.\n\nX. Newsletter sponsorships. I know it all depends on the newsletter and their audience. But even with ones that specifically had student audiences, the conversion rate of clicks to paying subscribers was abysmal. Makes me question if newsletter people don‚Äôt also throw in some bot traffic to inflate their numbers. Again, I‚Äôm sure some are great I just never encountered them lol\n\nX. SEO. To be honest I still think everyone should do this but make it a small 20 mins a week sort of thing and don‚Äôt expect results unless you have a big budget. When you‚Äôre a startup you need to focus on quick wins and SEO is definitely not one of them for me. I did 3 months worth of daily blog posts with no significant increase in Google traffic. (Also probably best to work with someone who knows SEO but I blew through my budget so it‚Äôs best I can do now)\n\nHere is what DID work:\n\n1) Running ads on the App Store. They‚Äôre crazy expensive BUT if you A/B test you will find that one version of your app screens & messaging that does much better than others and then you can get get really low cost downloads and sales. So when students search for specific keywords on the App Store my app shows up. Start with a SMALL BUDGET because it will just eat your money. Only bump it slowly if things are working. You won‚Äôt get anything by throwing in $100 on your first day. I wasted money like that x_x\n\n2) Mass posting of viral TikToks and YouTube shorts. Like two months ago there was a viral Reddit post here about VUBO which people were using to make brain rot videos as a side hustle. That gave me an idea so shoutout to the op. I used the texting stories template also with those Minecraft running videos in the background. All my videos start with a fake iMessage conversation between two people. Something like ‚Äúoh my god I got a 52% in Mr. Armstrong‚Äôs class‚Äù and an unhinged convo ensues lol. Then I mention my study app by name in the texting conversation. All those people search the App Store and find us. Took some trial and error before I made videos that crossed even 5K views but now I have an absolute banger which is gaining like 10-15k views daily for 3 weeks now. Just from 1 single TikTok that the algorithm decided to push. I‚Äôm still posting daily and trying to hire someone to help take over.\n\n3) Posting in Facebook groups where students buy and resell textbooks. Either I just flat out post about my study app or I will message people who are there and give them discounts to try my app. This one is super tedious and labor intensive and doesn‚Äôt really scale. Tbh I mostly stopped doing this as it feels spammy. And it has minimal returns. but if I was just starting over with 0 paying subscribers I would definitely go hard at this to get the ball rolling.\n\n4) Cold DMing the new followers of frat & sorority chapters on Instagram. This one is also kinda spammy and I stopped doing it lately but it did work to bring at least 10-20 paying subscribers after about two weeks of manual effort. I ended up getting temporarily banned on Instagram from doing it too much so probably just try it if it‚Äôs early on and you need first traction but maybe not the best idea long term.\n\nIf someone has any advice on what else I could try please let me know I will be super grateful. Thank you. I will also answer questions if someone has one.",

        "selftext": "We are celebrating our new product release and we would like to celebrate the occasion by getting a swag gift that we can put the new product's logo and such on for each employee. Ideally we would like to keep it to about $50 or less per gift.  \nMust be ok for men or women.  \nI would like it to be something fun they talk about for years. Yeti tumblers have been one of those items that we have done in the past.  \nWe will already be doing some personalized swag bags on top of this.\n\nETA- This is in addition to bonuses, raises, a big party, and larger ticket personalized, nonbranded gifts. Cash and gift cards are not an option for tax reasons. I beg you to please stop saying cash or gift cards. They are already getting those and it's not in my scope of power to just add it to their already fat bonuses they are getting.\n\nAnd it's not my personal business, so not my decision. I just plan the parties. :) This is literally just a fun, cute memento to be a sprinkle on top to celebrate the occasion. ",
