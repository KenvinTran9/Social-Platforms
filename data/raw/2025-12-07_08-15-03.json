Customers like buying from the person who built it.\n\nYou can't hand off sales until the playbook is truly systematized. \"Watch me do it\" isn't a playbook.\n\nAt low deal sizes, sales hires are math problems. $60K salary needs $200K+ in new ARR to make sense.\n\nI went back to founder-led sales.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nIn my network, there are quite a few startups that are building their startups solely around marketing funnels instead of products. And the most successful ones are using character-based marketing- creating some pixar-like/animated character and really leaning into that. That reminded me of Duolingo success as well.\n\nI thought why more brands are not using mascots/characters?\n\nSo I participated in a Cursor hackathon a month ago, won $15k 1st place cash prize, quit my job and committed to this idea full-time- and for launch we created this video:\n\n[https://youtu.be/W82pv-sXEHw](https://youtu.be/W82pv-sXEHw) \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and what people think about these kind of videos but since the tool is visual I thought the launch should be visual as well. Also, I got it done super cheaply and thought that this could bring in more impressions for the price than ads could- I might be wrong.\n\nTrends I am building for:  \n  \n1. Character-based marketing has been on an upwards trend, producing incredible results to companies advertising through consumer channels. Duolingo is the prime example.\n\nDistribution is everything nowadays and if mascots mean better ROI on your marketing efforts, then mascots it is! 📈\n\n2. We are betting that more and more AI-first software companies will associate their brands with characters- they all have character built-in, why not associate it with a memorable body? 🤖\n\n3. The amount of online (tech/ecom/digital products) business is growing exponentially. You can one-shot a calorie tracker app or a Shopify ecommerce store with a single prompt, but everyone is using the same tools and models to do so. 🟰\n\nThis means sameness all around- that’s where a well-developed brand character can become your moat.\n\nAnd personally, I am kinda done with this utopian futuristic minimalism.\n\nBut thats me.",

Sign up, extract value immediately, request refund.\n\nWhat I did:\n\nBlocked the BIN range from future signups.\n\nDisputed the refund requests with evidence (Stripe lets you fight chargebacks).\n\nWon 8 of 11 disputes.\n\nAdded velocity checks: more than 3 signups from same IP in 24 hours triggers manual review.\n\nAdded usage-based refund policy: refunds not available if you've exported more than 100 records.\n\nChanged trial: exports limited to 10 records during trial. Want more? Pay first.\n\nLosses: about $400 in refunds I couldn't recover.\n\nTime spent: probably 8 hours total.\n\nLessons:\n\nFraud finds every SaaS eventually. Have a policy ready.\n\nStripe's dispute process works if you provide evidence.\n\nFrictionless signup enables frictionless fraud. Some friction is protective.\n\nMonitor refund patterns monthly. Clusters indicate problems.\n\nOne bad week made me fraud-aware forever.\n\nHave you dealt with refund fraud?\n\n",

        "selftext": "I've been wanting to leave my corporate job for a while now and do something more hands-on. My wife and I were on vacation last month playing mini golf with the kids, and I had this random thought - I wonder what it actually costs to own one of these places.\r\n\r\nI started researching when I got home and went down a serious rabbit hole. Turns out mini golf course for sale pop up regularly, especially older mom-and-pop operations where the owners are retiring. The listings are all over the place though - some want $500k for a full setup with land, others are just selling the equipment and obstacles for way less.\r\n\r\nThe real eye-opener was learning about startup costs if you wanted to build from scratch. You're looking at easily $100k-300k depending on the size, and that's before you factor the land, permits, insurance, all the boring stuff. Even used obstacles and equipment aren't cheap when you need 18 holes worth.\r\n\r\nI spent weeks looking at everything - franchise opportunities, independent courses, even what it would cost to buy obstacles separately and piece something together. I found some interesting options through commercial equipment suppliers, auction sites, and even saw mini golf course equipment on wholesale platforms like Alibaba while I was comparing prices internationally.\r\n\r\nHaven't pulled the trigger on anything obviously, but I am genuinely surprised by how much goes into these businesses. Seasonal revenue in most places, maintenance cost, competition from other entertainment options. It's not the simple passive income situation I imagined.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here actually own or run something like this? Is it as much work as it seems, or am I overthinking it ?\r",

        "selftext": "\nHi team,\n\nI’ve been working on my startup as a side hustle alongside my university educated day job for 10 years now. The R&D has certainly come a long way bootstrapping the whole time. I’ve been scared to take any investment because I knew that I could bootstrap that little bit longer and as a result give away less equity the further along I got it. But it’s come at a cost I didn’t think about 10 years ago, I’ve swapped gained equity for life time. \n\nI feel so behind compared to my friends and family members of similar age who are all marked with children. I had a relationship for 8 years of the startup’s life and 2 years ago it all got too much and we separated. She wanted to move forward and I just couldn’t commit to having kids before the R&D was earning revenue. When I first started the startup at 24 I thought ‘I’ll be a millionaire in a few years’. It’s not about the money specifically, it’s about the financial security of being able to do something I love rather than the day job that I don’t love. But here we are now I’m 36 and single and I feel ashamed going on dates and admitting that I don’t have a house or a nice car (which would normally be associated with my day job). I’ve attached the idea of success in the startup to my def worth as a person. Deep down I think I’ve had the belief that I need the startup to succeed in order to be loveable - even to those that admit they love me because I was/am under the illusion I need to be successful before anyone could see me and was/am too ashamed at my position relative to where I thought I would be. \n\nI should add: the startup is in the biology and material science field. It takes a long time to grow things but the IP developed along the way compounds, it’s a little different to a software startup. \n\nTL;DR: The R&D is certainly close to investment level and I can’t stop, I just feel behind, embarrassed and ashamed at where I am compared to where I thought I would be at this point in life. I’m sure so many of you can relate - I’d love to hear your experiences to just help me realise I’m not a loser or alone and that it’s all going to be ok. For anyone else who needs to hear this: you’re not alone, I’m right hear with you and I hope it’ll all work out for us. \n\nMy takeaway/what I've learnt: James Dyson has been a major role model for me. I've always wanted to operate like him and be successful without external funding but we're not all James Dyson and have a product as revolutionary as that. I am learning to accept that 100% of 0 is still 0. It's better to own part of a million/billion dollar company than to own all of a worthless company. Time to ask for help.",

        "selftext": "Feeling defeated and I need advice from freelancers who've figured this out.\n\nClient hired me for a landing page: $2,000 for 20 hours of work (my rate is $100/hr).\n\nThen the extras started:\n\n\\- \"Can you add a blog section?\" (+10 hours)\n\n\\- \"Actually let's change the entire color scheme\" (+8 hours)\n\n\\- \"One more revision on the copy\" (+5 hours)\n\n\n\nI kept saying yes because I didn't want to lose the client or get a bad review.\n\nFinal tally: 43 hours worked, $2,000 paid.\n\nThat's $2,300 in unpaid work (23 hours × my $100/hr rate).\n\n\n\nFor those who've cracked this - what's your system?\n\n\n\nDo you:\n\n\\- Invoice immediately for every change request?\n\n\\- Have contracts tight enough to prevent this?\n\n\\- Just say no and risk the relationship?\n\n\\- Something else I'm missing?\n\n\n\nI can't keep doing this. Next project I need a better approach.\n\nAny advice appreciated.",
