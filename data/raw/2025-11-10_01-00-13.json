He doesnt even know how much better the competition is performing, because again, he doesnt work in the industry.\n\nHow does such a person pioneer things, or perform at the highest level as they constantly proclaim, when they dont even know the industry?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

They all claim to have the exact, niche experience I need.  If I ask them any questions regarding something technical, they give the correct answers...\n\nSo, I’ve made a new, 100% non-negotiable rule: A brief video call. No exceptions.\n\nA quick video call will give me a lot of info about the potential hire... \n\n1. It weeds out the fakes. The person sending flawless, scripted messages almost *always* crumbles when I ask them a basic question in real-time.\n\n2. It's a \"vibe check\" for cultural fit. My brand has a very specific audience. I need someone who gets the \"swag\" and lingo. I can tell in 60 seconds of a live conversation if they *genuinely* get it or if they just studied a script.\n\n3. It verifies their professional setup. You would be shocked at how many people I've gotten on a call who are trying to do their job from a phone. So if I am paying an hourly rate, I cant afford an inefficient setup.\n\n4. It verifies their tech. If the video call is choppy and they tell me they're \"on 4G,\" and I ask them if they can connect to an actual wifi or ethernet lan, and they tell me they don't have that... Red Flag...\n\nIt's a huge change from how I hired back in 2005, but it's the only way I can find real, professional talent.\n\nSo, is it just me? Or have you all had to do this too? What other methods are you using to filter candidates these days?",

My boos, let's call him \"visionary man\", is all sales and big promises. I'm the one who built the whole stack: Rust/Node APIs, Tauri/React desktop apps, manages all the servers, load balancing, database. I literally build all the engine for all high-stake client projects.\n\nThe amount of work done is huge, the pressure is constant, but the pay is nonexistent. For months, our Whatsapp chat has been a broken record: me begging for my weekly pay, and him giving the excuses: \"I'm at zero\", \"waiting for money to come in,\" or just to busy flying around. To keep me motivated, he only keeps talking up about the future, how we'll \"get rich\" later with his next big project ,and that I just need to be patient.\n\nThe whole thing blew up recently. He's obsessed with this personal project, and when it slowed down because I was actually focusing on my school and personal stuff, he went off on me. He accused me of not being dedicated, compared me to his own insane workload. He then threatened my financial stake: he warned that if he has to invest more of his own money to keep his pet project moving, **the whole percentage picture changes.**\n\nThis is the bottom line: I built the business assets, but he treat my labor like free capital, and now he's threatening my future.\n\nI need some advice of what decision should take, i don't have any experience with this things. What would an experienced entrepreneur do?\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions and provide more information about the situation, without revealing any personal details about the project or the company.\n\nSorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.\n\n\\[IMPORTANT EDIT\\]\n\nThank you for all the advice you've given me in this post. I think there were many details I didn't mention because I assumed they were obvious (obviously my mistake).\n\n* I'm 16 years old\n* I live in Venezuela\n* I never signed a contract to work for this person\n* I don't have legal permission to work\n* My boss has government connections, so it's unlikely I'd win in a legal battle.",
