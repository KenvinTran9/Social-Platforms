While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",

        "selftext": "I usually keep things private but I am at a point where I need insight from people who have dealt with real entrepreneurial stress and not the polished version that gets shared online.\n\nI built a construction company from scratch. No loans. No investors. No safety net. Just work ethic and showing up every day. In about thirty months we grew to more than 3 million dollars per year in revenue. \n\nWhen we reached that level I wanted to hire more people and stabilize cash flow so the company could continue growing in a healthy way. I went for an SBA loan to support hiring and operations.\n\nA national brokerage I worked with told me that in order to qualify for the SBA loan I needed to take certain short term financing products first. They presented this as a routine step that helps underwriting and repeatedly reassured me that the SBA approval was essentially done. They also told me not to apply anywhere else so it would not interfere with the process.\n\nI trusted them. And yes I know how stupid that looks now. I am not pretending I made a smart choice. I made a mistake. I believed someone who sounded confident and authoritative and it put me in a bad position.\n\nThe SBA loan never came. The promises were not real. And I ended up with aggressive short term debt that I never needed and never would have taken if I had not been told it was required.\n\nThe worst part is that having these short-term loans now blocks me from real lending. It does not matter that the business brings in over 3 million dollars per year or that the pipeline is strong. Every legitimate lender sees these obligations and says no. I cannot get the SBA loan anymore. I cannot get a term loan. I cannot refinance. It is an automatic rejection every time.\n\nThe business itself is not failing. The demand is there. The revenue is there. The work is there. What is failing is the financing situation that was pushed onto me under false guidance. And I am not losing the company but I am losing my mind trying to fix this while keeping everything running.\n\nI am working with attorneys because of how this was handled but that takes time and I need a practical path forward now.\n\nI am looking for guidance from anyone who has dealt with something similar.\n\nHas anyone been misled during the SBA process?\n\nHas anyone successfully negotiated or restructured short term financing?\n\nHas anyone brought in a private capital partner or done a revenue share to rebalance cash flow?\n\nWhere do entrepreneurs in this situation actually find lenders who understand real revenue instead of just looking at these short term loans as a red flag?\n\nI am keeping my identity private for obvious reasons but I am open to talking privately with anyone who has real experience with this or who invests in strong operators navigating temporary financial pressure.\n\nI built this company from nothing and it is not going under but my growth is now greatly hindered by these and I am asking for some direction in order to get out.",
