        "selftext": "Hey everyone, this post is going to trigger a lot of folks.\n\nI joined reddit 4 years back started following these different saas startups threads hoping to get some value. \n\nI started following all the constant advice - Build in public, Post about your startup on reddit, cold messaging. Everyone is lying here and they know it.\n\nI wasted 3 FUCKING YEARS of my life building businesses out of taking these suggestions and made $740 in 3 years. Then last year I met a founder backed by a16z who is running a 7M ARR company today. His advice changed everything for me.\n\nAnd I am going to share it because IT IS NO DAMN SECRET! Everyone outside of reddit who has ever built a real business knows these things!!!!\n\n1. Don't fucking re-invent the wheel. Just fucking copy what already is selling in market.\n\n2. Your product features mean shit if no one has ever looked at your product \n\n3. Don't waste your time doing product hunt launches and all the other retarded sites to launch your product. Its a trophy that no one gives a shit about.\n\n\nNow coming to the real deal\n\n1. Homepage matters much more than your actual website. Clear CTAs creating urgency and solving one and only one problem no confusion should be there. Best AI to make home page - \"Figma Make\" dont waste your time finding anything else. I have tested all of them for months. \n\nExample of homepage title \"Get 10x leads from X\"\n\n2. Never do cold emailing, IT NEVER works. Do linkedin outreach much much higher chances of working. Best and cheapest tool - \"linkedHelper\"\n\n3. Stop trying to build your audience and go VIRAL on linkedin twitter X or whatever fucking platform. If you want to build a company 20 years later then sure go ahead\n\n4. Just fucking run Ads, whatever 5k USD you were going to waste in the next 6 months fucking around with ZERO results put all that money and run FUCKING Ads.\n\n5. Unless really irrelevant, for most businesses ONLY run META ads. If your saas is complex and mostly for enterprises etc then run google search ads.\n\n6. META has fucked the platform and now static ads dont work you need only UGC. And please dont ever try AI UGC all those tools out there will generate you ZERO clicks from AI video ads.\n\n7. Get atleast 50-60 UGC pieces from real ugc creators. cheapest website to get UGC - bulba.app\n\n8. Take the UGC and run ads on those. dont EVER try to run ada yourself. Just hire some freelancer from india/philippines from upwork but with really good rating and past work. Don't fall into any agency trap. Always independent. They will do it even for $500.\n\n9. If you product is in $20-50/month range your flow should be signup -> 1 week free trial (with card) -> conversion.\nIf its $100+ then signup -> book demo -> 1 conversion. Only offer free trial for people who ask for that on the call. \n\n10. Then track conversion and drop rates in each stage and try to optimise to finally get a better ROAS.\n\n\nTHATS IT! and people who have done it know that this is how you build a business. And they are mostly not on reddit!\n\nBYE!",

        "title": "Why So Many Young People Feel Lost in a World That Never Stops Pushing",
        "selftext": "If you are in your late teens or early twenties, chances are you have felt it: a quiet but persistent sense that life is slipping by without real direction. You have ambitions like achieving financial freedom, building a family one day, giving back through charity, or simply having deep, reliable friendships. But somehow, the drive to make those things happen fades quickly. Motivation comes in waves, and the only time you feel truly alive and excited is during short escapes that leave you emptier afterward. You know you should get serious, start building habits, and chase what matters, but purpose feels out of reach. You are not alone in this. Millions of young people today wrestle with the same emptiness, and there is a clear reason why it has become so common.\n\nSomething fundamental changed around the early 2000s. Before that time, most people discovered their interests through living. You would go out into the world, experience something directly, feel a spark of curiosity, and then actively seek out more information using whatever tools existed. Schools, conversations with mentors, libraries, trial and error. Your path felt self-directed because it grew naturally from your own encounters and choices. You ended up where you were because you chose to go there.\n\nToday the flow runs in the opposite direction. Information floods toward you constantly through phones and screens, carefully selected and pushed by algorithms, companies, and hidden agendas. Interests are handed to you ready-made instead of discovered through experience. Attention gets captured before you even decide what you care about. Over time, this reverses the natural order: curated content shapes your desires, pulls your focus outward, and leaves you in a life that often feels like it belongs to someone else. The constant noise drowns out your own voice, making it hard to know what you truly want or why anything matters.\n\nThis reversal explains the widespread feeling of being stuck. When everything competes for your attention, nothing feels worth giving it to. Quick dopamine hits from scrolling, gaming, or other escapes become the only reliable source of excitement because they are designed to deliver instant reward. Meanwhile, the slower rewards of building skills, relationships, or long-term goals feel distant and uncertain. Purpose requires space, reflection, and ownership, but the modern environment leaves little room for any of those.\n\nThe way out starts with reclaiming control, one small step at a time. Begin by creating quiet moments each day to listen to yourself. Ask basic questions: What activities absorb me completely? What kind of person do I respect and want to become? Write the answers down honestly. This simple habit cuts through the external chatter and helps you reconnect with your inner direction.\n\nFrom there, pick one small action that moves you toward a goal you care about and do it daily. Ten minutes of reading about money management if financial freedom matters to you. A short walk or workout if you want to feel stronger. Consistency builds momentum far better than occasional bursts of effort. When distractions pull you away, notice it without harsh judgment and gently return to what you chose.\n\nSeek real-world connections that support growth. Join groups, clubs, or online communities built around shared interests. Show up as yourself, contribute, and listen. Authentic friendships and mentors appear when you engage steadily over time, not when you chase quick bonds.\n\nIf excitement only shows up in unhealthy ways right now, experiment with healthier sources. Try physical challenges, creative outlets, volunteering, or time in nature. These activities can awaken the same energy in sustainable forms.\n\nHelpful starting points include books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear for building reliable routines, or Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for understanding purpose in difficult seasons. Free courses on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy let you explore skills without pressure. Mindfulness apps can train your mind to stay present amid the noise.\n\nProgress will feel slow at first, and that is normal. Be patient as you rebuild the habit of directing your own life. By stepping away from endless feeds and toward deliberate choices, you create space for genuine meaning to emerge. Many have walked this path before you and found their way forward. You can too. The life you actually want is still within reach, waiting for you to start choosing it.",

I figured it'd be easier than hunting thrift stores every weekend. Half the sellers dont even have accurate inventory counts. I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast. Would love to hear if anyone cracked this.",

        "selftext": "I just spent my entire Sunday filming Instagram reels and I'm losing my mind.\n\nFreelance brand designer, three years in. Work is fine. But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
