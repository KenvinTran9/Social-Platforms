        "title": "Cousin’s fiancée wants 10% equity in my software company for one client introduction. Cousin is pressuring me to sign. Am I wrong for refusing? I will not promote",
        "selftext": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

        "title": "My YouTube videos get 100 views. They generate $12,000/month.",
        "selftext": "Most SaaS founders think YouTube only works if your videos get thousands of views. \n\nThat's wrong. And it's costing them their best growth channel.\n\n1,400 paying subscribers. Zero ad spend. \n\nMy videos average 100-200 views. I recently broke this system down on \n\n[Starter Story](https://youtu.be/W48emwbUlUE?si=fWaV7ItogeOGGmWY)\n\nYouTube isn't a views game. It's a search engine. And if you treat it like one, even tiny view counts can drive serious revenue.\n\nI'm going to break down the exact system what I call the Content Flywheel Growth Engine   \nand fuel for this engine is Customer Pain\n\n# Why low-view videos outperform viral content for SaaS\n\nHere's the core insight:\n\n>100 views from people actively searching for a solution are worth more than 100,000 views from people passively scrolling.\n\nWhen someone searches \"how to create a full wrap mug mockup in Photoshop\" at 2 AM, they're not browsing. They have a problem right now. If your video solves it, they don't just watch, they buy.\n\nThis is the difference between content-for-audience and content-for-customers. Almost every YouTube strategy you see online is optimizing for the first. SaaS founders should be optimizing for the second.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice: 63% of my YouTube views come from search. Of that, 26% comes from Google directly, not YouTube's own search bar.   \n  \n\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDGO-xbkAECPMV.jpg)\n\n63% People coming for search. 26.4% coming from google search\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDHBQZbwAAWg0B.jpg)\n\nGoogle Search accounts for 73% of external search\n\nPeople are Googling their problem, my video appears in the results, they watch it, and they become customers.\n\nThe videos don't go viral. They go useful. And useful compounds in a way that viral never does.\n\n# The Customer Pain Content Flywheel\n\nThe system has three steps, and each step feeds the next:\n\n1. Harvest customer pain.\n2. Turn pain into tutorials.\n3. Turn tutorials into search assets.\n\nThen the assets bring new customers, who bring new pain, and the cycle compounds.\n\n# Step 1: Harvest customer pain\n\nDon't brainstorm content ideas. Harvest them.\n\nEvery piece of content should come from a real person with a real problem. There are four places to find them:\n\n1. Communities where your customers already hang out.\n\nFacebook groups, Skool communities, Discord servers, Reddit.\n\nDon't go there to promote. Observe. Look for:\n\n* Questions that repeat every few days\n* Posts with unusually high engagement\n* Long comment threads, these signal unresolved pain\n\nEvery repeated problem goes into a running list. That list is your content calendar.\n\n2. New user onboarding emails.\n\nAs soon as someone signs up, send an email asking if they want a custom tutorial for their use case.\n\nMost founders would never do this for a low-priced, self-serve product. But here's what happens: users reply describing exactly what they're trying to do, where they're stuck, and what confuses them.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDIDgVbIAIaSyJ.jpg)\n\nThey hand you longtail content ideas for free.\n\nThe key is framing: \"Want me to make a tutorial for your specific use case?\" gets honest responses. A generic feedback survey doesn't.\n\n3. Support tickets and live conversations.\n\nThis is probably the highest value source of all.\n\nWhen a customer reaches out, don't just resolve the ticket. Ask them to share their actual files. Then record a screen share tutorial solving their specific problem.\n\nDo this consistently and you'll build a library of private support recordings, real edge cases, real language, real frustrations that never show up in keyword tools.\n\nOver time, I've recorded 1,500+ of these.\n\nMany of my best public tutorials are simply cleanedup versions of private support videos. The content already exists. You're just making it public.\n\n4. YouTube comments in your niche.\n\nComments are unfiltered objections.\n\nFind videos in your niche with a high comment-to-view ratio. That ratio signals a content gap, people watched, but their problem wasn't fully solved.\n\nScrape the comments. List every objection, confusion, and unanswered question. Then create content that fills those gaps directly.\n\nSome of my best-performing videos came from exactly this approach.\n\n# Step 2: Turn pain into tutorials\n\nOnce the pain is clear, creating the content becomes almost automatic.\n\nThe rule: create content for one specific person with one specific problem.\n\nBecause the pain comes from real conversations , not brainstorming,  you already know the exact words they use, the exact step where they get stuck, and the exact outcome they want.\n\nThis changes everything about how you create:\n\n* One problem per video. Don't bundle multiple topics. Solve one thing completely.\n* Use their language, not yours. If customers say \"full wrap mockup,\" that's your title, not \"comprehensive mockup automation tutorial.\"\n* Mass appeal is not the goal. A video that solves a real problem for one customer will solve it for hundreds of others searching for the same thing.\n\nThe content practically writes itself when the source material is real customer pain.\n\n# Step 3: Turn tutorials into search assets\n\nThis is where most founders leave money on the table.\n\nThey upload and hope the algorithm picks it up. That's a losing strategy for low view, high intent content.\n\nInstead, treat every video as a long term search asset. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's recommendation engine.\n\nHere's why: if you want to rank on Google with a blog post, you need backlinks, domain authority, and months of effort. With video, the bar is dramatically lower.\n\nA well structured tutorial targeting a specific search query can rank on page one of Google with zero backlinks. Searches like \"mug mockup full wrap\" or \"wall art mockup\" surface YouTube videos directly in Google results.\n\nThe SEO itself is simple:\n\n* Put the keyword in the title\n* Put it in the description\n* Address it clearly in the first 30 seconds of the video\n* Add structured chapters so both Google and AI tools can parse the content\n\nThat's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nEvery video becomes a permanent acquisition asset that works while you sleep.\n\n>Pain → tutorial → search asset → new customer → new pain → repeat. That's the flywheel.\n\n# \"I don't have time for content\"\n\nThis is the most common pushback. And it's based on a false assumption, that content creation is a separate workload.\n\nIt isn't. Not with this system.\n\nThe support recording you made for one customer? That becomes a public tutorial with 20 minutes of editing.\n\nThe question someone asked in a Facebook group? That becomes a video title.\n\nThe comment thread under a competitor's video? That becomes your content plan for the month.\n\nYou're not adding work. You're recycling work you're already doing into assets that compound.  \n  \n\n\n# Why this matters even more in 2026\n\nThere's a shift happening right now that makes this system significantly more valuable than it was even a year ago.\n\nAccording to \n\n[Ahrefs' research on AI citations](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-cited-domains-ai-mode/)\n\n  \n, YouTube is the second most cited domain in Google's AI Mode , with 961,938 mentions, accounting for 9.51% of all AI citations. Only Wikipedia ranks higher.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDKzi3aYAEVTbQ.jpg)\n\nAnd this isn't just a Google thing. YouTube is also the sixth most-cited domain by ChatGPT.\n\n OpenAI trained GPT-4 on over a million hours of YouTube transcriptions. YouTube content is baked into both the input and output of every major AI assistant.\n\nWhat this means is simple: when someone asks an AI tool a question, the answer increasingly comes from YouTube. But not from all YouTube videos, from videos with clear structure, proper chapters, and well-written descriptions.\n\nIf your videos don't have that, they're invisible to AI. And that's a growing share of how your potential customers will find solutions in 2026.\n\nThis is one of the problems I'm working on solving. I'm building youTube tools specifically for founders and operators who use video as a revenue channel. \n\n# The framework, summarized\n\nFor founders who want the quick version:\n\nHarvest → Find real customer pain from communities, onboarding emails, support tickets, and YouTube comments.\n\nCreate → Make one video per problem, using the customer's own language. Solve one thing completely.\n\nOptimize → Treat every video as a search asset. Keyword in title, description, and first 30 seconds. Add chapters. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's algorithm.\n\nCompound → New customers bring new pain. New pain creates new content. The flywheel accelerates.\n\nStop chasing views. Start solving problems on camera.\n\nThe founders who figure this out early won't need to buy ads for a very long time.\n\nIf this framework clicked for you, share it with a founder who's been told they need to \"go viral\" to grow. They don't.\n\nEdit - I didn’t expect this to resonate this much.\n\nA lot of people are asking whether this only works for certain types of businesses.\n\nIt doesn’t work for every business.\n\nHere's where I have seen it work/or should work\n\n-Shopify apps\n-WooCommerce plugins\n-Webflow tools\n-Zapier-style automation tools\n-AI tools that require prompts or workflows\n-Design plugins (Figma / Photoshop / Canva)\n-Technical B2B SaaS\n\nExample: TinyHost an Indie Product, already does $1M ARR using the same strategy.\n\nP.S. I’ve started writing deeper breakdowns of this system in a newsletter for founders using YouTube as a revenue channel. It’s linked in my profile if useful.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
