        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "When I open Reddit I see like 100 people pitching their startup idea, and a lot of them are basically the same: payment trackers, AI for hiring, generic productivity tools, etc. It feels like we’re about to see more software than ever before.\n\nI’m trying to find a good analogy, and the closest thing I can think of is what Shopify did for e-commerce. Lowering the barrier of entry unlocked a lot of creativity, but it also led to a massive wave of low-effort businesses. I think SaaS is heading toward a similar sloppification, possibly on a much larger scale.\n\nWe’re probably going to see more low-quality SaaS than ever, and I don’t think that’s just because of AI tools (even though they clearly accelerate this). The bigger shift is that the barrier used to be capital and deep technical skill. Now it’s much lower, which invites more non-technical founders, opportunists, and people trying to extract value quickly. This feels similar to how VC and PE incentives often lead to enshittification subscriptions everywhere, ads in cars, etc.\n\nThe effects already seem obvious: companies getting flooded with cold emails, distribution channels becoming completely saturated, and SaaS starting to resemble dropshipping more than product building. LinkedIn “build in public” and hustle culture just adds more noise on top of it.\n\nTech people can grift too, but more often there’s at least curiosity and a real attempt to understand the problem. My concern is that making a real living from SaaS will become much harder when every distribution channel is filled with low-effort, look-alike products.\n\nHow do you think this plays out over the next few years? Does the market self-correct, or does SaaS just become increasingly noisy with fewer real winners?",

APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though.

Guy contacted me in November wanting 200 custom hoodies for his company’s winter event. We went back and forth on designs, he approved everything, paid the 50% deposit, which seemed totally normal. He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit. I reached out immediately with all our email correspondence, the approved design files, his confirmation photo, everything. The payment processor said they’re still reviewing but it could go either way.   \nI’m out almost $4000 in materials and labor if this goes through. I’ve been researching wholesale suppliers on alibaba trying to find cheaper blank hoodies for future orders so I can build in more buffers for situations like this but that doesn’t help me now.  \n Do I need a lawyer?

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",
