        "title": "I analyzed 9,300+ \"I wish there was an app for this\" posts on Reddit. Here is the data on what people actually want.",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a project to track \"opportunity gaps\" on Reddit—specifically posts where someone describes a pain point and asks for a tool that doesn't seem to exist.\n\nI just finished processing a dataset of 9,363 unique opportunities from the last 6 months. I wanted to share the raw trends I found because they're pretty counter-intuitive for anyone looking to build a side project or SaaS right now.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Cloud\" Trend:**\n\nAbout 7% of all requests (640+ posts) specifically asked for offline-first or privacy-focused tools. People are getting \"subscription fatigue\" and want local-only versions of popular apps (especially in productivity).\n\n**2. The Big Categories:**\n\nProductivity: 1,231 requests (The most crowded, but highest volume).\n\nEducation/Self-Improvement: 698 requests (The highest \"willingness to pay\" sentiment).\n\nBusiness Tools/SaaS: 696 requests.\n\nHealth & Wellness: 656 requests.\n\n**3. The \"ADHD\" Niche:**\n\nSurprisingly, r/ADHD is one of the highest-signal subreddits. The users there provide the most detailed \"feature requests\" because current tools often fail their specific workflows.\n\n**4. App Type Breakdown:**\n\nMobile Apps: 61%\n\nSaaS/Web Platforms: 6%\n\nDesktop/Local Software: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~2% (Small but very high intent).\n\n**5. Timing:**\n\nMost \"frustration\" posts happen on Mondays and Tuesdays. People start their work week, hit a wall with their current software, and come to Reddit to complain.\n\n**6. Where the Money Is:**\n\nThe \"Willingness to Pay\" Index\n\nI scanned the data for keywords like \"buy,\" \"price,\" \"premium,\" and \"subscription.\" While Productivity has the most requests, it does not have the most people offering to pay.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Finance (193 pay signals): By far the most profitable niche. Users are asking for specialized portfolio trackers and risk analysis tools and are explicitly looking for \"premium\" versions that handle their data securely.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Online Commerce (76 pay signals): Shopify owners and small e-commerce sellers are vocal about paying for tools that save them time on shipping, inventory, or order syncing.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Travel (42 pay signals): This is a high-intent category. People are looking for \"pro\" travel planners or specific regional transit apps and are willing to pay for the convenience of a \"working\" solution.\n\nInsight: If you want a faster path to revenue, Finance or E-commerce tools beat \"General Productivity.\"\n\n**7. The \"Pain Level\" (Frustration Score):**\n\nI measured the length and detail of the posts. Longer posts generally indicate higher frustration and a deeper \"pain point.\"\n\nThe highest frustration scores come from:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Developer Platforms (229 avg length): Developers write long, technical \"rants\" about missing features in Spark, AWS, or NetSuite. If you solve these, you have a customer for life.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Cooking & Recipes (223 avg length): Users are angry about modern recipe sites being bloated with ads and \"backstories.\" They want ultra-minimalist, high-speed tools that just show the ingredients.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Parenting (221 avg length): Parents are highly descriptive about their needs (tracking sleep, milestones, or school schedules). This is an emotional, high-retention niche.\n\nInsight: Don't just look for many posts; look for long posts. A long post is a blueprint for a feature list.\n\n**8. The \"Last 60 Days\" Trend (What's Heating Up)**\n\nLooking at the data from November to January, we can see which categories are gaining momentum right now:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Health & Wellness & Gaming: These both spiked in December/January. This follows the \"New Year, New Me\" trend. People are currently hunting for gym trackers, habit-builders, and gamified life-management tools.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Smart Home & IoT: There is a recent wave of interest in \"Data Visualization\" for smart homes—people have the sensors, but they want better graphs to see how their home’s temperature/humidity changes over time.\n\n**Summary for your \"Action Plan\":**\n\n1. High Revenue / High Volume: Build in Finance. People are screaming for better portfolio analytics.\n2. High Gratitude / Low Competition: Build for Traditional Artists (Clean-up tools) or Parents.\n3. The \"Current Wave\": Build a Minimalist Smart Home Dashboard or a Gym Decision-Fatigue Tool.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nTop Niche by Pay Signal: Finance (193 signals)\n\nTop Niche by Pain Level: Developer Platforms (High Detail)\n\nFastest Growing (Jan 2026): Health & Wellness (New Year Trend)\n\nThe \"Anti-Bloat\" Opportunity: Cooking & Recipes (Users want text-only, no ads).\n\nI built a tool (neven. app) to help me parse all this data, but I thought these high-level stats would be useful for this sub.\n\nWhich of these categories is everyone currently building in? Happy to pull more specific stats from the data if you're curious about a niche.",

        "selftext": "hi everyone, \n\ni've been building serviceorca with my team, a zero-commission marketplace for service providers. We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

        "selftext": "Today I’m going to share with you exactly what my brother and I are doing to grow our [SaaS](https://taap.it/oyneU0f) and reach 10K MRR.\n\nJust a method we’ve been applying every single day for months.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Step 1 Build in public on TikTok & Instagram**\n\nFor over a year, we’ve been documenting everything. Every day.  \nWe share our doubts, the features in progress, the struggles, the small wins everything. And that’s what creates a real connection with our audience.  \nWe don’t sell in the videos, we just build a relationship.  \nAnd today, TikTok and Instagram have become our number one acquisition channel.  \nIt’s simple: people follow us, they see our dedication, they understand our product.  \nAnd the day we offer them to try it, they’re already convinced.\n\n**Step 2 LinkedIn: outbound + content**\n\nEvery morning, I reach out to 50 to 60 people on LinkedIn.  \nHighly targeted profiles. No randomness.  \nI check who liked or commented on a post related to our topic, and I start a real conversation.  \nNothing aggressive, I just suggest a chat.  \nThen I post on my profile, once a day.  \nEither educational content, storytelling, or a lead magnet.  \nThe posts that work best for us right now are niche lead magnets with a real promise.  \nYou get people to comment, create engagement, send them a DM and that’s how conversions happen.\n\n**Step 3 Cold Email**\n\nWe send about 500 emails a day with Instantly.  \nBut before that, we make sure our domain is warmed up, the copy is solid, and the targeting is right.  \nWe don’t go in all directions.  \nWe only target people who have shown intent.  \nFor example: if we’re offering an analytics tool, we’ll target SaaS founders who recently hired in marketing or posted a job for a SEO consultant.  \nThat changes everything.  \nBecause the message fits, and the reply rate skyrockets.  \nWhat matters is the substance of your emails not the style.\n\n**Step 4 X (formerly Twitter)**\n\nX works totally differently from other platforms: here, **interaction is the game**.  \nSo every day, I post 4 tweets spaced out during the day.  \nAnd I comment on at least 50 posts.  \nBut I don’t comment just to comment.  \nI bring a real perspective, I open a conversation.  \nAnd little by little, it brings followers, visibility, and conversations that can turn into customers.  \nWhat’s crazy is that there’s a strong SaaS community on X super valuable connections.\n\n**Step 5 Reddit**\n\nReddit is underrated in France.  \nBut when you start understanding how it works, it’s an incredible channel.  \nWe got over 200K views in 7 days with one well-written post.  \nBut be careful, Reddit is strict.  \nYou have to first interact with the community, get “accepted”, and then you can start posting.  \nWhen I post on Reddit, I never mention our tool directly.  \nI tell a story, share a lesson or a struggle.  \nAnd if people engage, I reply in the comments or redirect gently.  \nIt’s a powerful channel but you have to handle it with care.\n\n**Step 6 Patience and consistency**\n\nAll these channels take time.  \nBut you have to do it every day.  \nNot for 2 weeks. Not for a month.  \nWe’re talking **at least 6 months** for compound effect to kick in.  \nAnd it’s exactly because most people quit too early… that those who stick with it end up winning big.  \nWhat we apply is a simple discipline: each channel has its routine, we set clear goals, and we keep iterating.",

        "selftext": "I’ve noticed something repeat over and over in freelance DMs.\n\nSomeone reaches out with a small question. You answer thoughtfully. They respond with appreciation. Then they follow up with another “quick thing.” Then another. At some point you realize you’re effectively consulting for free, but it feels awkward to interrupt because nothing explicitly changed.\n\nWhat took me a long time to see is that the shift isn’t emotional, it’s linguistic.\n\nEarly messages sound exploratory. Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me. The conversation had already moved. I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nCurious if others have noticed the same thing or how you handle that transition without killing the relationship.",

        "selftext": "I just spent my entire Sunday filming Instagram reels and I'm losing my mind.\n\nFreelance brand designer, three years in. Work is fine. But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
