        "selftext": "So here’s what happened.\n\nI sold a handmade sculpture on Amazon, something I put a lot of time and care into. The buyer, a woman named Emily, got it just fine. Then out of nowhere, she messages me saying she wants to return it because it “looks better at a lower level.” Her exact words were basically that the eyes looked off when she put it higher up.\n\nI told her nicely that I can’t take it back for that reason. The piece looks exactly like the photos, and I’m not a big company that can just eat losses because someone didn’t like how it looked on a shelf. I’m one person making and shipping these myself.\n\nShe didn’t like that. She got defensive, saying my question “didn’t make sense” and that the “advertising didn’t match her hopes.” Whatever that means.\n\nThen she started opening return cases. Three of them. Each time she gave a new reason. The last one? She claimed the item was “defective.” Totally false. Nothing wrong with it, she just didn’t like how it looked where she put it.\n\nAnd guess what? Amazon **refunded her in full** without even checking if she returned it. She didn’t. She still has the piece and the money.\n\nSo now I’m out the cost, the time, and the product, all because someone abused the return system and Amazon just automatically sided with her. No evidence, no verification, nothing.\n\nI reported everything to Amazon and posted about it on the forums because this is getting ridiculous. I followed every rule. The listing was accurate. The photos were clear. And yet somehow, a customer can just say “defective” and walk away with both the product and a full refund.\n\nI’m honestly just fed up. This kind of thing might be nothing to a big company, but for a small artist, it hurts.",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

They all claim to have the exact, niche experience I need.  If I ask them any questions regarding something technical, they give the correct answers...\n\nSo, I’ve made a new, 100% non-negotiable rule: A brief video call. No exceptions.\n\nA quick video call will give me a lot of info about the potential hire... \n\n1. It weeds out the fakes. The person sending flawless, scripted messages almost *always* crumbles when I ask them a basic question in real-time.\n\n2. It's a \"vibe check\" for cultural fit. My brand has a very specific audience. I need someone who gets the \"swag\" and lingo. I can tell in 60 seconds of a live conversation if they *genuinely* get it or if they just studied a script.\n\n3. It verifies their professional setup. You would be shocked at how many people I've gotten on a call who are trying to do their job from a phone. So if I am paying an hourly rate, I cant afford an inefficient setup.\n\n4. It verifies their tech. If the video call is choppy and they tell me they're \"on 4G,\" and I ask them if they can connect to an actual wifi or ethernet lan, and they tell me they don't have that... Red Flag...\n\nIt's a huge change from how I hired back in 2005, but it's the only way I can find real, professional talent.\n\nSo, is it just me? Or have you all had to do this too? What other methods are you using to filter candidates these days?",

Always been self employed, never had a job - had self sustaining revenue and lived well since college. \n\nAfter exiting my last company- i spent a few years pursuing the arts - music, comedy and a social media career. I partied a lot spent money and dealt with some mental issues and that didnt really go anywhere due to issues in my personal life (wife)\n\nNow i have been working on a new business - that is somewhat similar to my old business, with learnings. \nI got into this mostly cause money running out - neccesity. vs my first company, which was very much my entire identity and a life long mission. \n\nIt seems ive lost the spark- have had a bunch of ups and downs with the new company (maybe economy? Or competition). But it feels like because i already got wealthy i have just lost that Killer instinct. \n\nMy rational mind says figure it out.  Build and sell new business and focus, then make a run on the creative endeavors again. \n\nHas anyone else \"peaked\" and gotten the spark back?",
