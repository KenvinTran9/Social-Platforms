        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Like optimizing for rage-farm engagement. \n\nI can already hear the usual line on posts like these:\n\n“BuT YC iNvEsTs In FoUnDeRs NoT IdEaS, bRo.”\n\nThe bar for their founders is actually relatively low. Also, at some point, “we invest in founders” has basically become a get out of jail free card for low bar picks. If you keep repeating that mantra while backing shallow products, it does say something about what your actual bar for founders is.\n\n  \nIt’s not crazy to assume that they’ve passed on founders building real, painful, unsexy problems so they could fund “look at this Chad programmer lol” type products instead.\n\nAt some point their batches stopped looking like “a few weird bets that might work” and now looks like they outsourced their decisions to a dice roll.\n\nSo I guess \"build something people want\" and \"solve a problem\" are just not a thing in this climate. What I'm curious about are the other sheep investors who may actually follow them in this trend.  \n",

        "selftext": "This is a very specific industry that consists of pool and bar management at hotels. There is one major player in our area that has bought up a bunch of smaller companies over the years, but they don't have a great reputation with customer service oddly enough. However they are branded well, have multiple officers and warehouses all over the area, you can't even hit a stop light without looking up with one of their vehicles. \n\nI've been tasked to help a company who is taking a slightly different approach to these contracts grow their business but of course that means going after monopoly contracts. These deals are multi-year so when you miss them it could be another 3-5 before you get a chance to bid again. A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",
