I have the contract on autopay and last year after it went up to $350 from $280, I saw on my invoice that I had the option of opting our of the contract because of the size of the price increase, but and that payment meant that I opted in. I didn't notice until after the bill was auto paid. So I looked at my bill every month waiting for the next increase. Sure enough, it went to $450 this month. I called a different waste company and they quoted me at $140 a month. I called WM to cancel the contract and they asked to match. I said I would listen. They quoted $135. I said no. Got another call today with the price of $90. I said no again. I would rather the company that hasn't cost me thousands a year. \n\nRandomly a supplier (a paper company because I am a printer), who I used to use more before finding a slightly inferior alternative at a 10% better price, offered me MUCH better pricing (18% lower than the cheaper option) on a product that should be in between quality of their old paper and the different company's paper. \n\nI am currently going to reach out to a company that does maintenance on one of my machines at an unfavorable rate to see if they will match the maintenance contact on a different machine which I use more now. \n\nBy the end of the week, I can save about $20k a year by calling and negotiating.

        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy.

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.
