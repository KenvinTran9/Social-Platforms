        "selftext": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

        "selftext": "Not sure if other app devs are seeing this, but wanted to share a shift we made recently that’s honestly been bigger for our growth than ASO or traditional SEO.\n\nA few months ago, we started getting feedback emails saying things like, *\"I asked ChatGPT for a cycling app that focuses on privacy\"* or *\"Gemini recommended you guys as a good Strava alternative.\"*\n\nIt happened enough times that we actually updated our onboarding survey. We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

Then they follow up with another “quick thing.” Then another. At some point you realize you’re effectively consulting for free, but it feels awkward to interrupt because nothing explicitly changed.\n\nWhat took me a long time to see is that the shift isn’t emotional, it’s linguistic.\n\nEarly messages sound exploratory. Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me. The conversation had already moved. I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nCurious if others have noticed the same thing or how you handle that transition without killing the relationship.",
