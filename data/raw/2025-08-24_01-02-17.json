        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My name’s Rob & I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts.\n\nA couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day.\n\nI started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently.\n\nFirst off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS \"guru\" preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different.\n\n**My secrets to a successful launch day:**\n\n**Building in “Stealth”:** I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready.\n\n* Posted screenshots asking \"who wants to try this?\" - no product links\n* DMed interested people to join private beta\n* Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building\n* Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better\n* Built hype so launch day went that much better\n\n**Launch Day Momentum:** When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD.\n\n* Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials → 50,000 views\n* Screenshot PostHog analytics → 20,000 views\n* Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard → 10,000 views\n* Every win becomes content that drives more wins\n\n**Why Photos Matter:** Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples’ attention.\n\n* People root for underdogs (probably you)\n* Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era)\n\n**The Numbers Game:**\n\n* 70 free trials in 24 hours\n* 50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%)\n* 200,000+ views on X in 24hrs\n* 95% of traffic from organic X posts\n\nOver 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, I’m at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending.\n\nAsk me anything about:\n\n* Failing 5 times and what I learned\n* Building in \"stealth\" while still posting publicly\n* Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta\n* Launch day execution\n* Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else\n\nGoal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible.\n\nHappy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :)\n\nLet's gooo!\n\n(I'll be sticking around most of the day to answer questions. And I'll try my best to answer any asked even after today, so don't hesitate to leave your question!)\n\nEDIT: This was a lot of fun, thanks so much for asking all of your questions - there were some really great ones! I'll have to bookmark this myself so I can come back and re-read my answers, since I dropped most of my brain in here today haha. Catch you all next time or on X (hopefully past $10k MRR)! :D",

        "title": "Buying a business- what I learnt the hard way",
        "selftext": "\nIt’s been a year since my business buying hunt began. Since this group has many businesses I wanted to share my observations. \n\nI started by looking for something in a very specific niche but after talking to few sellers and looking at an exorbitant ask, I decided to expand and look at similar businesses. I don’t have any personal connections with a business so these have all been interactions with strangers (sellers I found on broker websites). In total I have now looked at 16 businesses seriously (over 100 overall). \n\nHere goes: \n\nAlmost 90/100 times - the business is overvalued - not just a little over but really overvalued - think $500k ask = $250k reality. A lot of them are getting this number from metric calculator or AI. They choose 1-2 years maybe 10 years ago to demonstrate “profitability”. Often, sellers are not realistic unless they genuinely engage with the buyer. Also, they often come up with numbers based on an upcoming life goal. Like a ladies kids were graduating and she wanted $79k for their tuition so she was adamant on the price. It had nothing to do with the books. Remember, you’re not here to buy someone’s retirement home. \n\nBrokers are the worse- at least the 29 of them I’ve interacted with. None of them come from finance and multiples are pulled from the magic hat. A lot of them misrepresent. There is a hands off business (absentee owner) floating on business for sale. When you talk to the manager- you find out he’s the owners father. For first time sellers- brokers also set up lots of call to show you that you have so many people interested but they don’t wet sellers and sometimes don’t tell the seller what the business is about. They do this so you don’t bring down the price. Know that a lot of buyers you’re meeting may not know everything about your operations because they are told - “seller does not want to release anything till you talk to them”. However, if they know you’re in the industry or have bought before - they are usually nicer (based on my friends experience not mine). \n\n10/100 sellers don’t want to sell. They are just browsing to see what’s the market and who will pay for their ask (a random number from their magic hat). These are usually sellers- who will just talk, ask for a number and won’t ever send you any documents or will send a screenshot from some excel for one year (3 years ago) where the business made $$$. Tip: don’t waste your time if they don’t have books.\n\n10/100 sellers are actually selling for legit reasons. Retirement, relocation and ill health are the most common legit reasons. These sellers are hard to find. \n\nMost sellers ask for projections and potential of the business. Like skin care is a billion dollar industry. They make 100k/year and ask is $5mil- because it’s a billion dollar industry. \n\nMost pull potential and expansion plans from Google- like pay more for more marketing, add more sales people etc. etc. - if it was true, they’d have done it. \n\nA lot of businesses are bleeding money- you need to know where to look. Someone on Reddit mentioned this when I first started research and I didn’t take it seriously. I was fixated on clean books. But now I know better- ask about every expense in the books. It doesn’t matter whether it’s $1 or $10k. Even small things like hidden memberships, trade shows etc. - ask for proof or Google to see if they were in attendance etc. \n\nAccountants and lawyers will only give you advise- they won’t negotiate for you. You have to be proactive. Ties into - #7 - a stationary receipt is an expense but not for a business that’s pressure washing- dig and you’ll find it could be their child’s back to school stuff. It’s fine for a few expenses here and there but you should know where it’s coming from. \n\nMake seller transition exhaustive- paying 6figures? Don’t take a one week or one month transition. You won’t learn anything. Unless you’re a pro from the same industry. If the business has been running for 2 years - ask for 60 days and add a business that ran for 10 years - ask for 6 months. Don’t be flexible. Sellers disappear if they’re not obligated by the agreement. Also, be fair - don’t exploit their time. \n\nService businesses- clients could be tied to the personal goodwill of the seller. Can’t elaborate more as I didn’t look too deep in this. \n\nDon’t pay what you can’t handle. Know your budget. Know that when you buy- you’ll need to enter and clean house to make it profitable. That money can’t go to the Seller. It’s like buying a house- qualifying for the mortgage is different from buying furniture when you get the house. Don’t take out loans - you can’t payback. Don’t over leverage. It’s not worth it. \nThe best value is to ask yourself- can I do a better job starting this with money I have versus paying it to the seller- if yes don’t buy it. Buying a Business should help you skip a few steps and get ahead faster - not something that leaves you recovering for years. \n\nWhile you don’t need to be super passionate- you do need to know what you’re doing and like it. If you’re not technical (like me) don’t look at SaaS- it’s a waste. Don’t think you can outsource everything. People will take you for a ride. \n\nGood sellers (based on positive experiences): \n\nThey want to work with you. They will be more reasonable if you point out issues politely.\nThey want their brand to continue beyond them- you can tell from their voice and passion that they want the business to succeed after them- they will try their best to set you up for success. These are the nicest sellers. \n\nThey’ll tell you when they made a mistake - yes they don’t want you to mess up so they’ll tell you what they tried and why it didn’t work. \n\nThey want to be included for a while with the transition- they don’t want to dump it on you and run the next day. \n\nThey are open to creative ways of financing if they like you (not always true- sometimes they do need the money). \n\nThey care about long term employees. \n\nLessons: \nDon’t buy a business on autopilot- it doesn’t exist.\nDon’t buy a single owner operated business- like crafts or custom work unless you know the skill. \nDon’t be attached to the business before you close. \nTalk to the seller. Listings can be deceiving. \nWalk if you don’t like them- it’s not worth the hassle. \nPay what you’re comfortable with not for potential, cash money etc. \nIf you can start it and make it succeed faster then don’t pay for it- do it. \nDon’t buy a business to quit a job. \n\nIf you’re a seller what has your experience been? I am curious. \n\n",

Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze.

I have removed dozens of posts that are some iteration of \"go to Gumroad and buy this ebook/PDF/guide that will help you freelance\" (one even stated that its purpose was to help you create ebooks with AI to sell to freelancers). I have also removed dozens of posts of market research/promotional spam related to \"vibe coding\" tools.\n\nI've been moderating this subreddit for more than a decade (!), so I'm used to periodic surges of inappropriate posts because some YouTuber made a video telling people to submit things to Reddit, or because some virtual assistant course mandated that its students make marketing comments here, or because Reddit itself decides that increased posts and traffic are more important than subreddit rules and moderators' time. Unfortunately, I am currently at the point where I need the firehose of incoming spam to stop. I need at least a couple of days, but reserve the right to continue this until the end of the month.\n\nComments are on. Please be respectful.",

        "selftext": "Everyone talks about validating ideas but nobody actually does it right.\n\nYou make some surveys. You ask friends. You post in Facebook groups asking \"would you pay for X\" and people lie to your face because they want to be nice.\n\nI got tired of building stuff nobody wanted so I started doing something different. I just steal ideas directly from people complaining on Reddit.\n\n**How it actually works**\n\nI found this tool that scrapes Reddit for people literally begging for solutions. Not \"market research\" or \"would you be interested in\" posts. Real threads where someone is pissed off and saying \"why the hell doesn't this exist yet.\"\n\nLast month I pulled 50+ problems in my niche in about 10 minutes. Each one had direct links to the Reddit thread so I could see exactly how people were describing their pain.\n\nThen I picked the one that showed up most often and built exactly what they asked for.\n\n**Building the actual thing**\n\nI used the same platform's project management thing called BuildHub. Its nothing fancy but it keeps everything connected to the original Reddit posts so you dont lose sight of what people actually wanted.\n\nMost founders build what they think is cool. I built exactly what Reddit users were already asking for word for word.\n\n**Finding customers who already want it**\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The platform includes access to Linkeddit for free (normally costs $99 value).\n\nLinkeddit finds the exact Reddit users who were complaining about the problem you just solved. Then it helps you write posts and comments that get their attention without sounding like a spam bot.\n\nSo instead of cold outreach or hoping your launch post gets traction, you're literally going back to the people who asked for this thing in the first place.\n\n**Results so far**\n\nThree weeks in and I have 47 people on my waiting list. All from the original Reddit threads where I found the idea.\n\nZero paid ads. Zero cold emails. Zero \"growth hacking.\"\n\nI just solved a problem people were already complaining about and told them I solved it.\n\n**Why this pisses people off**\n\nSome people think this is \"unoriginal\" or that you should come up with ideas from scratch.\n\nThose people usually have zero paying customers.\n\nI'd rather copy a proven problem than invent one nobody cares about.\n\nThe tool I used is called [BigIdeasDB](https://www.bigideasdb.com). Try it if you want to stop guessing what people want and start building what they're already asking for.\n\nAm I wrong for just copying what works instead of trying to be innovative? What do you think?",

        "selftext": "Many freelancers struggle to keep clients and get referrals. There are four simple rules I adhere to:\n\n1. Always overdeliver. Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",

When I was researching about web hosting and stuff, I found out that there are multiple types of web hosting and this is kinda confusing for me tbh.\n\nWhen I googled, I found \"Top 5 web hosting providers for small businesses\" but every blog had the same 5 web hosting services and now I was more confused. I found this hostingbattle website as well where they had 30+ web hosting providers listed according to different types of hosting and they had detailed info about web hosting services but then the problem is that I am noob in terms of web hosting and I don't know if I should go with shared web hosting or dedicated web hosting lol.\n\nCan you guys help me understand what kind of the web hosting should I choose if I have digital products like ebooks.\n\nThank you in advance.",

It’s either discouraging (“why can’t I do that?”) or just noise.\n\nPersonally, I’d rather read:\n\n* How someone landed their *first paying customer* after 30 rejections.\n* How someone grew revenue from $0 → $500 MRR and what broke along the way.\n* What mistakes cost them *time and sanity*.\n\nThat’s the real stuff. The gritty details. The part you don’t see in the “2-day SaaS to $500k exit” fantasy.\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but I’m starting to tune these out like spam.\n\nCurious — is anyone else getting tired of these “overnight success” posts, or do you still find them motivating?",
