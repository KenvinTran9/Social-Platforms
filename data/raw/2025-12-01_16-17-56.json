        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai) in May, and we made around $34K in November\n\nIt hasn’t all been smooth sailing, so I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently.\n\nQuick disclaimer: when I started this SaaS, I had zero audience in the niche I was targeting. However, I already had experience in SaaS, having built and sold one that reached 500K ARR pretty fast. So I knew how to handle a team, find a CTO cofounder, etc.\n\nIt’s definitely not easy. The first months mean no salary and constant reinvestment. Without experience and being solo, building a SaaS feels almost impossible.\n\nFor me, it’s a “second stage” business, something to do once you already have some money and security.\n\nToday we have over 300 customers and more than 30,000 monthly website visits. Here’s how we got there.\n\nWhat didn’t work: Twitter is still super slow, my account didn’t take off. SEO is super slow; we spent quite a bit on articles, but results take time. Cold calling also wasn’t worth the effort.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n\\-Reddit brings about 30% of our traffic. We post daily across subreddits, mixing value posts, resources, and updates. It drives a lot of volume, though conversion rates are moderate. (You probably saw us a lot on Reddit... yes... it works !)\n\n\\-Outreach is our top conversion source. We use our own tool, to find high-intent leads showing buying signals on LinkedIn, then reach out via LinkedIn and cold email. We send 3000 emails per day + as many linkedIn invitations as we can.\n\nWe get 3-5x more replies by email and on LinkedIn with our own tool compared to when we used Apollo or Sales Indicator databases. Using your own tool is honestly the key to building a successful SaaS, you always know exactly what needs to be improved.\n\n\\-LinkedIn inbound works great too. We post daily, and while it brings less traffic than Reddit, the leads are much more qualified. We use 3 accounts to post content. Some days it can bring us 10 sales.\n\nOur magic formula is 3k emails sent per day + 1 LinkedIn post per day + 5 reddit posts per week.\n\n\\- Our affiliate program has also been strong. We offer 30% recurring commissions, and affiliates have already earned over $3K. The key to a successful affiliate program is paying your affiliates as much as possible and giving them a full resource pack so it’s easy for them to promote your tool including videos, banners, ready-to-post content, and more.\n\n\\-Free tools worked incredibly well too. We launched four and shared them on Reddit and LinkedIn, which brought consistent traffic and signups every day. It’s pretty crazy because we put very little effort into it, yet every day people sign up for trials thanks to these free tools.\n\n\\- One big shift was moving from sales-led to product-led growth. Back in May, I was doing around 10 calls a day. It worked but wasn’t scalable. Now people sign up automatically, even while I sleep, and we only take calls with larger teams. It completely changed my life.\n\n\\-Influencer posts : We pay influencers to post about us on LInkedIn, it has been working really well. \n\nWe’re a team of three plus one VA, spending zero on ads. Our only paid channel is affiliate commissions.\n\nOur goal for end of December was 1m ARR. It will be less. We failed but it's growing.   \n  \nIf you have any questions, I’m happy to share more details and help anyone building their own SaaS.\n\nCheers !\n\n[Proof](https://gojiberry.ai/proof)",

She hasn't been giving me her time, so I moved her from a fixed rate contract to an hourly contract, telling her it's because of tax reasons. She didn't work the next 2 days, but stayed clocked in, while keeping her computer active with low activity.\n\nI then confronted her the next day during the review. I told her I know she's not giving me her best, and that she did all the work in 1 hour before the review. She told me she was sketching to get ideas those days. I interrupted and told her to stop. I told her that I think we both know if I asked her to show me sketches for those days, she wouldn't be able to show me anything. I told her I think she's a brilliant designer, but we need to hit reset on our relationship, because she's using her brilliance in order to try and get away without working. She's been giving me better work since, but she submitted 2 days where she clearly did nothing.\n\nPart of me is a bit upset, and I'm having to resist the urge to go through hour by hour and pick out all the times she's not doing any work for me. Should I just pay the 2 days of work she didn't do anything, or should I set a precedent of she doesn't work, she can't submit the hour.\n\nReplacing her would be a huge hassle.",

We just hit 40k MRR last month but I cannot shake the scarcity mindset and it's starting to affect how we operate. Like I'm talking about obsessing over every single expense to an unhealthy degree.\n\nLast week my business partner wanted to upgrade our project management software to a plan that costs an extra $200/month and I literally spent two hours building a case for why we didn't need it (fun factwe definitely need it) I just couldn't handle the idea of adding another recurring cost. She was pretty mad at me and I fully understand here I just don't know the reason behind me being like this\n\nI grew up pretty broke and bootstrapped this thing on like 3k and now even though we're profitable and growing I still operate like we're one expense away from shutting down. I review our business checking account basically every day. I still use a personal card for a bunch of business expenses because I feel guilty putting them on the company card even though that makes no sense whatsoever\n\nMy partner thinks I should talk to a therapist about it which honestly might not be a bad idea but I'm also super curious if anyone else deals with this? Like at what revenue point did you stop feeling like every dollar going out was a personal attack? Or does it never go away?\n\nThe ironic thing is I'm probably COSTING us money by being so cheap since we're definitely underinvesting in tools and people because I'm too anxious about everything? Anyone has any tips on how to improve with the way I'm dealing with everything? Thank you",

        "selftext": "Maybe it’s not much but I feel like it’s a great success given that I started with no portfolio and no network a few months ago. \nI have to say I got lucky getting those clients, but I think everyone deserves some luck sometimes 😅\nAt the moment it’s not quite enough for feeding my family alone but I hope eventually I’ll be able to do so.\nI just wanted to share this with you guys as I am very happy and excited to be here. I never thought it was possible for me to start like that. I mean I was working in a company a year ago and now I’m doing my own thing. It’s exciting and I have already learned so much. \n\nWishing you all the best for your journey being or becoming a freelancer. \n",
