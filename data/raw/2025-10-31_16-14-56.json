        "selftext": "My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip).\n\nPersonally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts.\n\nMy barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy.\n\nI have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable.\n\nI suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly & efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc.\n\nThere is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower.\n\nHe took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster.\n\nSomething I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",

        "selftext": "Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation.\n\nContext: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead.\n\nI sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work.\n\nThey went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading.\n\nThis morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached.\n\nThey want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here.\n\nPart of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jxtujji6yf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb53723b067c6ddadac9b593edf1b46a22dc38f\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone. Tommy here. I'm 3.\n\nFour days ago I was watching cocomelon on my iPad when YouTube autoplay threw on a Dan Martell video. Something about \"buy back your time\" resonated with me - mostly because nap time was cutting into my block-stacking sessions.\n\nDan said something like \"find a problem, build a solution, scale it.\" I looked around my daycare and noticed a clear market gap: nobody was monitoring the structural integrity of our block towers. Silent failures everywhere. Millions in imaginary revenue at risk.\n\nSo I opened up Bubble (my fine motor skills aren't great yet, but I can drag and drop). Built \"BlockGuard\" - real-time monitoring for block tower stability with AI-powered collapse predictions. Integrated Stripe because that's what Dan said to do.\n\nLaunched on Product Hunt Tuesday morning (right after Paw Patrol). By Wednesday we hit $30M MRR. Thursday morning a16z called during snack time and offered $1.2B. I accepted because I wanted to get back to my blocks.\n\n**Here's what I learned:**\n\n1. **Solve real problems** \\- Block tower collapses were costing my peers valuable play time\n2. **Move fast** \\- The window between breakfast and morning nap is shorter than you think\n3. **Charge what you're worth** \\- I initially priced at $0.50/month (one fruit snack). Raised to $99/month. Nobody blinked.\n4. **AI is a moat** \\- Used Claude API to predict collapses 30 seconds before they happened. Game changer.\n5. **Compete on speed** \\- While other kids were still learning ABCs, I was learning ARR\n6. **Know when to exit** \\- $1.2B lets me buy a lot of goldfish crackers\n\n**The boring stuff:**\n\n* Tech stack: Bubble + Supabase + Claude API (couldn't figure out AWS, I'm only 3)\n* Customer acquisition: Posted in r/blocks, got 47 beta users\n* First revenue: 6 hours after launch\n* Used [FailureFinder.com](http://FailureFinder.com) to monitor my Zapier automations because even at $30M MRR, broken workflows will kill you\n\n**What's next:** Honestly? Probably fingerpainting. I'm diversifying into physical art because that's what all the successful founders do after an exit.\n\nHappy to answer questions, but I've got a juice box calling my name.\n\n\\- Tommy, 3",

Fast forward 8 months and we've spent probably 80k on implementation consultants, our finance team has been basically useless this entire time because they're drowning in configuration meetings, we STILL don't have it fully set up and half our team refuses to use it correctly because it's so goddamn complicated for basic tasks   \nIMO I think ERP only makes sense when you are a manufacturing company with complex supply chains and inventory and whatever but for a saas startup it's kinda useless. We're paying sales people buying software subscriptions and occasionally ordering laptops. Why do we need enterprise resource planning for that? The worst part is everyone's too proud to admit it was a mistake at this point and we're stuck with it.

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

I told him that i can give him a report and I'll submit the report with all the weeks progress but he is arrogant.\n\nI'm not liking the fact that he is treating me like a scammer but in reality I've helped him and I've got solid results. Ive almost completed 99% of work and it's all positive.\n\nI don't know how to deal with him!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\nI bought a cafÃ© bar about two months ago and honestly, itâ€™s been chaos since day one. Within the first couple of weeks, all the staff (including both managers) left. I started hiring again and got a new manager, but every other week someone quits. Itâ€™s like a revolving door.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of our regulars have stopped coming â€” they donâ€™t see the same faces or the same vibe anymore. Iâ€™ve been working long hours every single day just to keep things running, even though Iâ€™m paying my venue manager a solid wage. Now even heâ€™s thinking about leaving and Iâ€™m completely drained.\n\nI pay everyone fairly (all legal rates, no dodgy stuff), but still canâ€™t keep staff. Anyone been through this after buying a business? How did you get things back on track or rebuild a stable team?",
