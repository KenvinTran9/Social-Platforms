Truth is, most people should just get really good at their jobs, negotiate better pay, and invest wisely.\n\nStarting a business isn’t the answer for everyone. Some of you will be way happier as top-tier employees than stressed-out, struggling entrepreneurs. And that’s okay.\n\nFight me.\n\n",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "For more than a decade founders have been building the same categories over and over. Mobile apps, web apps, SaaS dashboards. All solid ideas in the past, but today these markets are so saturated that even excellent teams struggle to get noticed.\n\nWhat almost nobody is paying attention to is the new ecosystem emerging inside ChatGPT. Website traffic is already slipping because users simply ask their LLM to handle the task. And now that ChatGPT Apps exist, full applications with real UI and logic run directly inside the chat. If you are not familiar with them, just watch the announcement from OpenAI on YouTube.\n\nOpenAI will also introduce a full App Store for ChatGPT Apps at the end of this year. Here is the important part. ChatGPT can recommend and use apps automatically, even if the user never installed anything. Distribution happens inside the model itself.\n\nChatGPT has around 800 million weekly users. The Apple App Store had roughly one billion in 2025. The difference is that the ChatGPT App Store is still empty. No incumbents. No real competition. Opportunities like this are extremely rare and the potential is huge.\n\nMany categories can be rebuilt natively for LLMs. Shopping tools, price comparison services, booking engines, finance dashboards, workflow systems, enterprise products. None of the existing solutions can be dropped into an LLM unchanged, so the playing field resets. Anyone who understands this early can release an LLM native version of a proven model and become relevant before the established players react.\n\nYou do not need to outperform the incumbents. You only need to become visible enough to be a threat. When that happens, big companies will either hurry to catch up or eventually buy the challenger to protect their market.\n\nLearning how ChatGPT Apps and MCP work requires some effort, but the upside is entering a new market before everyone else shows up.\n\nIf you want to explore it, just google around. There are already resources and a few early tools that explain how to build these apps.",
