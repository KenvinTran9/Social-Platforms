All the knowledge from running businesses, having employees (never again btw, hated the HR part), the clients, the failed projects: it all adds up eventually. You get better every time.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody tells you: with age comes responsibility that eats your time.\n\nI have a family now. Two kids, one is 17 months old. For the past 24 months my schedule has been: start at 7:30am when family leaves, work, quick lunch, work, dinner, then build until 1am when kids are sleeping. Weekends too. Oh and we renovated our house and had a newborn in between.\n\nLately I notice my son understands more and more every day. He's watching. And I don't want to be the absent dad behind a laptop.\n\nI love what I'm building. But I'm also exhausted. When this product launches I'm taking a real break. My kids won't be young forever.\n\n**So why am I posting this?**\n\nFor the younger people here: the time is now. You have something I don't anymore: time without tradeoffs. No kids waiting for you. No mortgage. No partner wondering when you'll be done.\n\nLearn. Take chances. Build. Fail. Do it again. You can absorb the hits differently at 25 than at 40.\n\nMake some fun too obviously.

Like responding to emails at 11pm, hopping on calls whenever they wanted, basically being their personal support bot.\n\nMy retention was okay, around 65% after 6 months which isnt terrible but not great either. Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",
