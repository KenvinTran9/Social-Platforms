I automatically think this person is just dumb. Who in the world wants to spend a dollar to save 35 cents. It makes sense if you were going to do it because it’s a necessary thing for your business to grow but it’s just an expense, of course it’s not going to count towards your taxable basis. Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense. Any expense necessary for a business to improve of course should be deducted as an expense",

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.
