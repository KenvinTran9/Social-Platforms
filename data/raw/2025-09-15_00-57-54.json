I’m thinking okay boring but respectable.\n\nThen he casually drops that 90 percent of his revenue isn’t even local. It’s from selling sponges gloves and mops overseas. And not just a little. We’re talking 7 figures a year. Off cleaning supplies.\n\nMeanwhile I’ve been breaking my back trying to compete in my crowded local market stressing over ads margins and standing out. And this guy’s over here quietly crushing it with something everyone overlooks.\n\nIt honestly flipped my perspective. Maybe the real opportunity isn’t grinding in the same oversaturated local market as everyone else but finding buyers in places that actually need what you’re selling.\n\nSo now I’m curious. Has anyone here actually broken into international markets early, was it a nightmare or surprisingly doable once you figured out where to look?",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy.

Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this?

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",
