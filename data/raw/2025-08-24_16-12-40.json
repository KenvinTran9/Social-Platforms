        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My name’s Rob & I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts.\n\nA couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day.\n\nI started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently.\n\nFirst off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS \"guru\" preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different.\n\n**My secrets to a successful launch day:**\n\n**Building in “Stealth”:** I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready.\n\n* Posted screenshots asking \"who wants to try this?\" - no product links\n* DMed interested people to join private beta\n* Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building\n* Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better\n* Built hype so launch day went that much better\n\n**Launch Day Momentum:** When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD.\n\n* Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials → 50,000 views\n* Screenshot PostHog analytics → 20,000 views\n* Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard → 10,000 views\n* Every win becomes content that drives more wins\n\n**Why Photos Matter:** Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples’ attention.\n\n* People root for underdogs (probably you)\n* Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era)\n\n**The Numbers Game:**\n\n* 70 free trials in 24 hours\n* 50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%)\n* 200,000+ views on X in 24hrs\n* 95% of traffic from organic X posts\n\nOver 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, I’m at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending.\n\nAsk me anything about:\n\n* Failing 5 times and what I learned\n* Building in \"stealth\" while still posting publicly\n* Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta\n* Launch day execution\n* Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else\n\nGoal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible.\n\nHappy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :)\n\nLet's gooo!\n\n(I'll be sticking around most of the day to answer questions. And I'll try my best to answer any asked even after today, so don't hesitate to leave your question!)\n\nEDIT: This was a lot of fun, thanks so much for asking all of your questions - there were some really great ones! I'll have to bookmark this myself so I can come back and re-read my answers, since I dropped most of my brain in here today haha. Catch you all next time or on X (hopefully past $10k MRR)! :D",

Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything.",

For years, U.S. buyers have been one of our biggest markets, keeping designers on budget, and honestly keeping my 200+ employees in jobs as well.\n\nNow with all this talk of a 25% tariff on furniture imports, I’m just… exhausted. Others are rushing to front-load shipments now, trying to beat the tariff window. Meanwhile, my workers are asking if hours will be cut, and I don’t even know how to answer them.\n\nWhat makes it worse is, even if these tariffs happen, does anyone really believe thousands of Americans will suddenly want to clock into a cheap furniture factory in North Carolina or Ohio tomorrow morning? We all know the answer. The U.S. makes maybe 20% of its own furniture right now, the rest is imported.\n\nInstead of generating more jobs, this just feels like a tax on everyone: higher prices for U.S. families, canceled orders for exporters like my company, and a ton of uncertainty hanging over small businesses who are already stretched thin.\n\nThis could be the first time trade policy is threatening my entire business. Has anyone else here had orders disrupted or fears of it because of tariffs? How are you preparing? Any suggestions for me? \n\n",

We're at the point where more than 90% of the post submissions violate the rules.\n\nWhile some of this is the standard \"I didn't read the subreddit rules and don't understand that this isn't /r/forhire, so please hire me/work on my project\" stuff I am used to dealing with, I suspect a lot of the increase is due to AI. I have removed dozens of posts that are some iteration of \"go to Gumroad and buy this ebook/PDF/guide that will help you freelance\" (one even stated that its purpose was to help you create ebooks with AI to sell to freelancers). I have also removed dozens of posts of market research/promotional spam related to \"vibe coding\" tools.\n\nI've been moderating this subreddit for more than a decade (!), so I'm used to periodic surges of inappropriate posts because some YouTuber made a video telling people to submit things to Reddit, or because some virtual assistant course mandated that its students make marketing comments here, or because Reddit itself decides that increased posts and traffic are more important than subreddit rules and moderators' time. Unfortunately, I am currently at the point where I need the firehose of incoming spam to stop.

Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback after I had delivered everything - payment just got yanked back. 😩\n\nI’m shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I’m trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",
