        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "Quick background: I left my PM role at a Series B about 11 months ago to build a SaaS that automates compliance reminders for dental offices. Small TAM — around 4,200 practices in the US. 6,800 if you count veterinary, which I've started doing in my projections.\n\nReal pain though. I watched our office manager spend 40 minutes a week on this. Built the MVP in 3 weeks (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel). Whole thing costs me $8.11/month to run. I know the exact number because I check Vercel billing every morning.\n\nLaunch was rough. Posted on HN, got 3 upvotes and one comment: \"Is this AI?\" It's not. It's cron jobs and Twilio. But I did start putting \"AI-powered\" in my meta tags for SEO, because the cron job evaluates a condition before sending each reminder, and at some level that's what inference is.\n\nSo I started grinding outreach. Scraped every dental practice within 200 miles off Google Maps, found the office managers on LinkedIn, and sent 1,847 personalized messages over 6 weeks. Personalized meaning I swapped the practice name in the first line. One office manager replied \"Hi \\[PRACTICE\\_NAME\\]\" so I know at least one person read the whole thing.\n\n11 replies. 2 asked me to stop. 1 was a lawyer — not about the product, his practice genuinely needed compliance reminders, he just also wanted me to know I was violating CAN-SPAM. The other 8 booked demos or asked for more info, 6 converted, those 6 referred 14 more, and cold email plus Reddit brought another \\~30.\n\nCurrent numbers: 53 paying customers, $4,150 MRR, \\~12% MoM growth. Churn is 4.7%, but most of that is practices closing or merging. If I exclude involuntary churn, seasonal adjustments, one guy who I'm pretty sure signed up by accident, and a practice that emailed me \"please stop texting our patients\" — which I'm classifying as a feature request — it's closer to 1.8%.\n\nThe problem: I got a letter last week from a practice's legal team calling my outreach \"unsolicited commercial messaging.\" Which — yes. My plan was to hire a VA to scale to 500 messages/day across LinkedIn, email, and Facebook groups. I've already created a second LinkedIn profile for this. The question is whether a third is overkill or just good redundancy. Has anyone dealt with this?\n\nThe other problem: I haven't paid myself in 11 months. My girlfriend keeps asking about this. I keep explaining that $4K MRR is essentially $48K ARR which is essentially a salary, the business just needs it right now. She asked when the business won't need it and I said probably around $15K MRR. She Googled how long that would take at my growth rate, showed me her phone, and didn't say anything. We had a quiet dinner. I've started referring to her as my \"co-founder\" in conversations because it feels more accurate than \"person who pays rent.\"\n\nThinking about raising prices from $49 to $79. Some customers already say $49 is a lot for automated text reminders, but I think they're undervaluing peace of mind. You can't put a price on peace of mind. Well, you can. It's $49. But it should be $79. I ran a Van Westendorp analysis on this but only surveyed myself.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Not linking the product because last time someone called it \"just Calendly with extra steps\" and I'm still processing that emotionally.\n\nEDIT: Sorry if i don't respond to your comment/dm, never got so many before so i'm adjusting.",

Just a landing page.\n\nAnd it made me think about how backwards most of us do this.\n\nLike, most founders (myself included, guilty) do this: Build the thing → Launch it → Hope people care about it. Which is kind of insane when you think about it. You're basically betting months of work on a hunch.\n\nBut the really successful people I've been following? They flip it completely. They market first. They validate demand when it costs them literally nothing. Then they build.\n\nDropbox did this with a demo video and got 75k signups overnight.   \nRobinhood had a referral waitlist that hit a million users before they even had a real product. Buffer validated their entire business model with just a pricing page in 48 hours.\n\nThe pattern is wild once you see it.\n\nWhen you market before building, you're not just wasting time. You're actually testing if people give a shit. You're building an audience while you're in the development phase. You're validating demand with zero code written.\n\nThat last part is probably the biggest thing. If you can't get people excited about the problem you're solving before you build the solution, honestly... you probably shouldn't build it at all.\n\nThe best validation isn't code. It's attention.\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around how differently this changes everything. Like, we're so obsessed with shipping the perfect product that we forget to check if anyone actually wants it first.",

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How?

APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

        "selftext": "I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",
