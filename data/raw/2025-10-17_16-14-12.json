I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "selftext": "Six months ago, I posted something that garnered a couple of dozen views. “Cool,” I thought, and decided to try running my account with no content plan and no strategy. I just wanted to share my thoughts. Later, it turned into a tool for building my reputation, and now I’m not even sure: am I running LinkedIn, or is LinkedIn running me? :)\n\nToday, I’ve gathered some numbers, results, and fun facts, and answered some of my followers’ questions.\n\nDo recruiters and HR people reach out? No, not really. And that was my plan. Here’s why: I’m not job-hunting and don’t position myself as a candidate. I’m building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I’m overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my “strategy” will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I’m not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I’ve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn’t my goal, though.\n\nI didn’t expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I’m satisfied :)\n\nI’ve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it. I’m grateful to the people who read me. It makes me happy, and I encourage everyone who enjoys writing to just keep doing it, even if your reach isn’t impressive yet.",

They're literally almost half my revenue.\n\nThe problem: they're a nightmare. Disorganized records, last-minute requests every week, constant \"urgent\" messages on weekends. They treat deadlines like suggestions. Last month I stayed up until 2am 3 nights in a row because they send me a box of receipts the day before their filing deadline.\n\nEveryone tells me to stop serving them. My partner says I'm miserable every Sunday night. My friends say no client is worth this stress.\n\nBut here's the thing - $5k/month is $5k/month. That's half my income. If I fire them, I'd need to replace that with 2-3 smaller clients, and I barely have time to do sales because this client eats up all my time.\n\nSo I'm stuck in this loop of keeping them = good income, constant stress, no time to grow or Fxxk them off = happy life, almost 50% revenue cut, risk of not replacing the revenue\n\nI have about 4 months savings. Part of me thinks \"just rip the band-aid off\" but then I panic about paying rent.\n\nHas anyone been in this situation? What did you do?

You can feel that things are taking off.\n\nThis VC needs a company in its portfolio that specialized in intent signal data.\n\nOne of our clients who raised funds with them mentioned us, and that’s how they reached out.\n\nNo ads, no funding, no team bigger than three people and one VA.  \nJust systems, community, and endless hours of work.\n\nI feel like I’m living a dream because the development of our tool is going incredibly well.\n\nSo when someone suddenly says “we’ll wire you money” it forces you to stop and think.\n\nWould it accelerate growth? Probably.  \nCould we hire faster, build faster, and push into new markets? Definitely.\n\nBut there’s also the other side.  \nRight now, every decision we make is ours.  \nWe can change direction in a day, launch a new product overnight, or experiment without needing approval.  \nWe’re profitable, growing, and free.\n\nThe question is, what’s the real cost of that $1 million?\n\nI’ve never raised funds through VCs, and I always told myself that if I ever did, it would only be if Y Combinator accepted me one day (I’ve actually been rejected three times 😅).\n\nBut for those of you who *have* raised funds, what’s the real benefit? What are the traps to watch out for?\n\nOf course, if I decide to move forward, I’ll get legal support, but I’d love to hear insights from people who’ve already gone through the process. Thanks!\n\nCheers",
