The weird part is, the more it grows, the more I’ve started thinking about how tied up my personal life is with all of it.   \nI’ve seen friends lose half their business after a divorce, and it honestly freaked me out a bit. It’s not even about trust it’s just realizing how fast something you built from scratch can get tangled up in stuff that has nothing to do with work.   \nI’m in a serious relationship now and things are good, but for the first time, I’ve actually caught myself thinking about stuff like prenups or protecting ownership. Never thought I’d be that person, but here we are.\n\nAny other business owners hit that point where you start looking at marriage a little differently once there’s a company involved?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Anyone claiming otherwise is lying in plain sight, and I am sick of reading about these lies every now and then.\n\nSure, tools make building easier: AI, \"vibe coding\" and so on.\n\nBut that's exactly what’s killing startups. It's now almost impossible to build a moat. Every product-market fit (difficult per se to find in a solutions over-saturated world) turns into a red ocean in the blink of an eye.\n\nBefore you even manage to build an MVP and get early traction, ten other ventures are already doing the same thing - burning money and making any roadmap to profitability useless.\n\nThe only remaining way to build a moat is through distribution (and distribution only, while it used to be a mix) - and that’s the most plutocratic asset of all. Those who already have customers have money, and those with money can afford to lose more of it, for longer, even in a red ocean.\n\nTo some extent, this has always been true. But now it's 10x, maybe 100x worse.\n\nNewcomers’ efforts are fragmented; they never reach the critical mass to become something meaningful. In the best-case scenario, they get acquired early by incumbents just to speed up existing processes - so nobody really profits from the initial risk.\n\nAs a \"job\" when you weigh risks and opportunities, building startups is becoming less and less viable.\n\nIs that a sterile complaint? Yes.\n\nIs it wrong? You tell me.",
