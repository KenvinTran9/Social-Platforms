Like what products we use, how we price square footage, what our turnaround times are, stuff like that. I figured he was just one of those detail oriented clients.\n\nRecently I'm at a local business networking thing and someone mentions they just hired a new cleaning company. I ask who and its literally this same guy. Turns out hes been running his own cleaning business the whole time, just started it in August. All those \"jobs\" he hired us for were him basically taking notes on our entire operation.\n\nHe even asked me once about our employee retention and I told him we give small bonuses when we hit quarterly goals because it keeps people motivated. Now Im wondering if he copied that too. The whole thing has me stressed and Im glad I at least have some money saved aside personally because I might need to pivot some things if he starts undercutting us.\n\nPart of me wants to be annoyed but I dont know if I can even do anything about it? Like he technically paid for services so its not illegal or anything. But it feels shady as hell. Should I just let it go or is there something Im supposed to do here?",

I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it.

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
