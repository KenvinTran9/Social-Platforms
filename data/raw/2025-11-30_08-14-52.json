He spent like 2 hours tracking people down in slack asking about random charges from weeks ago that nobody remembers. The day after I had lunch with him and he looked pretty sad and he (I didn't brought it up) brought up how it's super hard to deal with the expenses in our company since nobody is responsible\n\nThe worst part is he's genuinely a great guy and I feel terrible watching people take advantage of how nice he is. He'll never push back or enforce consequences so everyone knows they can just submit whenever and he'll deal with it\n\nI know there's nothing from my side that I can do about this but I just want to know if I can propose something to him in order to fix this. I'm also planning to talk to some of our coworkers and ask them to be more responsible because they're literally adults WITH KIDS who are doing this.

I started this small travel agency a couple years back, nothing crazy, but it somehow worked and I made like 70k over time. As I started making money I also started traveling a lot, just seeing the world, learning stuff… one of those trips was to Kenya.Someone I met there took me to this Hass avocado farm. I swear I didn’t even care about farming before but something about that place stuck with me. The trees, the export thing, the whole operation… don’t know why but it hit me.\nBefore that I was just doing the travel agency thing, but then the whole model started getting copied everywhere and abused. Margins dropped, everything felt off, so I shut it down before it ate everything I worked for.When I got back home I kept reading about Hass avocados nonstop. Like for two years. Everything from seedlings to climate stuff to yields and prices. Deep rabbit hole.Then I found some land in Ethiopia that fit everything I learned and I bought it. Honestly that moment felt wild, like “damn… this is mine.”And now I’m kinda just sitting here thinking, ok… what’s the actual next move?\nIt’s weird going from a travel agency to avocado farming. Didn’t expect life to go this direction at all.Anyone else ever make a complete switch like this?How do you know if you’re moving smart or just chasing something because it felt right in the moment?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

The client was referred to me through a friend and wanted some branding work done for a food business she’s launching. I have been regularly updating her showing her my work progress and illustration. She’s expressed to me that she’s pretty satisfied so far and asked for a few reasonable tweaks over the course of the project. After checking in with her today, it’s as if she’s done a 180 and is now telling me to essentially trace the AI reference she showed to me at the beginning of the project. To clarify she stated from the beginning that she liked my illustration style and graphic design work and was only showing me an AI reference image to visualise what she’s unable to create herself.  As someone who specialises in illustration I am quite against using AI generated drawings. So it feels like a slap in the face and a waste of my time to have her say she likes my work so far, when clearly she must’ve been lying or apprehensive about it all along and just wanted slightly customised AI art. I’m quite hurt and i don’t know how i should move forward. Any thoughts?",
