Inventory didnt match sales, we were going through way more supplies than we should for our ticket averages. I initially blamed it on waste or bad tracking on my end.\n\nLong story short, caught her on camera giving free drinks to friends and taking cash sales without ringing them up. When I confronted her she got defensive and said \"everyone does this at coffee shops\" and that I should be grateful she brought in so many regulars. I had to let her go.\n\nHere's the crazy part. I was terrified wed lose customers. But ever since she left our sales have actually been up. Not just a little better but like consistently better numbers. I think she was pocketing way more than I even realized and her \"regulars\" were probably just people getting free stuff.\n\nMy other employees seemed relieved too which was unexpected.

        "selftext": "I am a small business (state of Florida)- 12 employees plus myself and my partner.  We've been in business for 18 years and I have processed a good many state-mandated wage garnishments for child support so I am well acquainted with the process.\n\n  \nThis week I was served papers by a process server for a Continuing Writ of Garnishment against one of my employees.  This is not child support related but rather a debt owed to a bank for about $3,500.00.  The papers were served by a law firm and have been filed with our local court.  These read very differently from the regular child-support garnishments I am used to.  This garnishment letter states that my failure to execute all documents and as well as begin garnishing wages in a timely manner could result in the full debt obligation being charged to us (our company).  \n\nI am directed to fill out the paperwork enclosed, expedite return to the law firm and file a copy with our local clerk of court within 20 days of receipt.\n\nAnd the fee I can charge for all the work - $17.  State of Florida allows a $5 admin fee for the first payroll garnishment and $2 each payroll after.  I have to pay for the expedited return shipping of docs to the law firm.  I have to pay for the filing fee with the clerk of court.  And $17 does not begin to cover the amount of administrative time that will be applied to this endeavor.\n\nIt absolutely BOGGLES my mind that I am expected to bear the costs for this person's inability to pay their bills or handle their personal finances.  Not only that but if I fail to respond/take action quickly, I could be responsible for HIS debt!!!  \n\nI am upset and outraged.  I have enough expenses and worries being a small business owner.  Now I have to also handle/solve the debt issues of those I hire??  Insane.",

        "selftext": "Working in tech sales at a large 8 figure SaaS. Wanted to share our 2026 setup for personalizing cold emails at scale since our team spent a lot of time & money refining this process.\n\n**Here's our workflow that's been working:**\n\n1. In our CRM we prepare two custom fields under people leads: 'prospect\\_post' and 'custom\\_message'\n2. The 'prospect\\_post' field will get filled with a LI post from the prospect, that we scrape using predictent.ai\n3. We then run GPT 4o mini over the 'custom\\_message' field and generate a custom message based on the data in 'prospect\\_post'. If the messages aren't good enough we refine with a stronger model e.g. GPT 5 or Gemini 2.5 Pro\n4. We export this data to CSV and import directly into our cold email provider, the custom\\_message gets parsed as a {{custom\\_message}} variable in the first line.\n\nThe difference vs generic outreach is night and day. Instead of *\"Saw you're hiring\"* we're hitting them with\n\n*\"Noticed you just announced your Series B and are expanding into EMEA - here's how \\[our product\\] helped \\[similar company\\] scale their \\[specific use case\\] across 12 countries...\"*\n\nThe signal monitoring with custom messaging is what makes it actually scalable. We're not manually researching every prospect or relying on basic firmographic triggers. We're catching real-time events that indicate genuine buying intent, and the AI layer makes it sound human and relevant.\n\nResponse rates are up \\~3x compared to our old approach. Worth considering if you're still spending hours on manual research per prospect.",
