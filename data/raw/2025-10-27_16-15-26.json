        "selftext": "Yeah, you read that right. We burned through an extra $50k not because our developers were slow, but because we were idiots about what an MVP actually costs.\n\nEveryone tells you to focus on the \"minimum\" and \"viable.\" What they don't tell you is that \"code\" is maybe half the battle. We obsessed over features and engineering timelines, and completely ignored the iceberg of costs lurking below the surface.\n\nOur first big punch to the gut? Legal. We launched our app, got a bit of traction, and then Apple rejected an update. Why? Our privacy policy and terms of service were garbage templates we pulled offline. That was a frantic two week scramble and a $5,000 bill from a lawyer we hadn't budgeted for.\n\nThen came the marketing \"budget.\" We figured the product was so good it would sell itself. Spoiler: it didn't. We had to spend thousands on ads just to get our first 100 users. Another unplanned expense.\n\nBut the real killer was support and operations. As soon as people started using the product, the bug reports and \"how do I do this\" emails flooded in. My cofounder and I were spending half our day answering support tickets instead of building the business. The \"viable\" part of our MVP was a joke because the user experience, including support, was terrible. We had to hire a part time support person way sooner than we planned.\n\nThis is the stuff the \"lean startup\" gurus conveniently forget to mention.\n\nAn MVP isn't just a piece of software. It’s a tiny, functioning business. And businesses have costs beyond the factory floor.\n\nSo here’s the rule we now live by at my agency: Take your most realistic, padded developer estimate. Then, add 50% on top of that for the \"everything else\" fund. This covers your legal setup, your initial marketing spend, your analytics tools, your server costs that will inevitably spike, and the cost of actually supporting your first users.\n\nAnd even that is before you add a 25% \"shit will hit the fan\" buffer. Because it always does.\n\nStop thinking of your MVP as a product launch. Start thinking of it as a business launch. The code is just the ticket to the game. Actually playing it is what costs you.\n\nWhat's the dumbest non code cost that almost sank your startup? Let's hear the war stories.",

        "selftext": "I started a small manufacturing business with my best friend from college close to two years ago. 50/50 partners. Everything was great until about six months ago or so.\n\nWe have a shared business account but we both also use our personal cards for business stuff pretty regularly cuz if you're at home depot or whatever it's very normal to use whatever card is in your wallet. The problem is that he's just TERRIBLE about telling me what he bought or sending receipts.\n\nLast month I'm going through our bank statements and I see all these random Venmo transactions I don't recognize at all. Turns out he's been paying contractors in cash and venmoing himself reimbursements without documenting anything. When I asked him about it he got defensive and said I should 'trust him' and that I should not worry about it which is fucking crazy because I don't have a single bill screenshot nothing to know what was paid\n\n We've been friends for 15 years but I also need to know where our money is going because I've worked so fucking hard for this business and I barely get 6 hours of sleep every SINGLE day (including weekends) for it to work. We're not a lemonade stand we have actual obligations and I'm pretty sure our accountant is going to murder us at tax time.\n\nThe worst incident was two weeks ago. He bought a 3.8k piece of equipment that we'd talked about but hadn't decided on yet. He just bought it. Using his personal card btw and he didn't mention it at all. I found out because the company that sold it called OUR business line asking about delivery and I had no idea what they were talking about and I had to play dumb on the phone\n\nWhen I confronted him he said he saw a good deal and didn't want to bother me and now I'm the asshole for being upset about an unauthorized 3.8k purchase? He says I'm being controlling and acting like his mom.\n\nI don't want to ruin our friendship but I also just can't run a business like this. Have any of you dealt with this? How do you set up financial boundaries with a business partner without making it weird?  \n  \nI'm sorry everyone for the long post but I'm not sure how to solve this and just keep the friendship at the same time",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "Late last year, I was sitting in a hostel kitchen somewhere in Southeast Asia, staring at my screen, genuinely questioning what the hell I was doing with my life.\n\nI had spent months building “projects” that went nowhere. I’d launch, push a few tweets, get 10 signups, and then watch everything flatline. I kept telling myself *maybe I’m just not cut out for this.* Everyone else seemed to “get it” except me.\n\nI almost quit. Like actually quit.\n\nBut I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was close to *something.* Not in terms of the idea, but in terms of **finally understanding how to build something people actually want.**\n\nSo I tried again.\n\nThis time, I built the most *unsexy* thing I could think of: a tool to generate consistent illustrations for product UIs and brand kits. No VC buzzwords. Just solving the exact pain I had in my own projects.\n\nI worked on it daily — not in huge heroic sprints — just *small improvements, every day.* Fixing onboarding. Tweaking landing pages. Improving exports. Answering emails. Making the output 5% better each week.\n\nFor a long time, nothing happened.\n\nThen slowly:\n\n* Designers started using it for their client websites\n* Indie founders started using it for product UI\n* My inbox stopped being quiet\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* The app just passed **tens of thousands of users**\n* I don’t have investors, employees, or a cofounder\n* It’s just me, my laptop, and a ridiculous amount of iteration\n\nIt still doesn’t feel “real.”  \nEspecially because for so long it felt like **I was failing in silence.**\n\n# The part no one tells you:\n\nYou don’t need a “big idea.”  \nYou don’t need a 12-slide deck or a growth plan.  \nYou don’t need to be loud on Twitter.\n\nYou just need:\n\n* One real problem\n* One real user who experiences it\n* The willingness to keep improving when no one is watching\n\n# The biggest lessons this time around:\n\n* **Onboarding matters more than features**\n* **Charging earlier is not rude — it’s clarity**\n* **Small daily iteration beats “big launches” every time**\n* **Most people quit right before things start compounding**\n\nIf you’re in the phase where it feels like *nothing is working* — don’t assume that means it’s not working.\n\nSometimes the difference between $0 MRR and $5K MRR is just **staying in the game long enough for compounding to show up.**\n\nMy app is called [**illustration.app**](http://illustration.app) — but the name doesn’t matter. What matters is I didn’t quit this time.\n\nNext milestone: **$3K–$10K MRR**.  \nBack to work.",
