About 2 months in she said she wanted out so with the support of my husband, I bought her out.\n\nOver the past year I have grown the business significantly and again with the support of my lovely husband, we are now in a position to scale.\n\nNow enter my sister who is saying it is not fair because she put in a lot of work initially and gave me the encouragement to start in the first place. She should receive come further compensation and would like me to pay her £5000 one off or £500 monthly.\n\nWhat should i do?  If this was a friend I would burn bridges but this is my younger sister!!I am thinking I don’t want to be taken advantage of because of my good nature but also don’t want to lose my sister. My family and parents think I am being selfish and should compensate her. My husband is 50/50 as deep down I know he thinks if he tells me to tell her to get fucked, I will resent him or something.\n\nPlease give me your unfiltered advice. How should i play this?!\n\nUpdate: TY everyone for your replies. She took at job 2 months in as she needed a stable income. We were making very little in the beginning. I bought her out for £37,000 and we had both initial put in £17000. legally I don’t owe her anything and everything was done properly. i feel like such an idiot but at the end of the day she is still my little sister so my emotions are all over the place with this one. I can afford to pay her but feel like the way she is going about it is just so wrong. If she asked me for money I would happily give it to her but why come at it like this. Anyways thank you all again. I will think awhile before I decide.",

At some point you realize you’re effectively consulting for free, but it feels awkward to interrupt because nothing explicitly changed.\n\nWhat took me a long time to see is that the shift isn’t emotional, it’s linguistic.\n\nEarly messages sound exploratory. Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me. The conversation had already moved. I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nCurious if others have noticed the same thing or how you handle that transition without killing the relationship.",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
