        "selftext": "Saw a post earlier today about how lonely the founder‚Äôs path really is. I dropped a long reply there, but this topic hit me so deep I felt it deserved its own thread.\n\nHere‚Äôs the truth nobody hypes on LinkedIn:\n\nStarting a company is like breaking out of prison. The 9 to 5 cage feels safe through steady paycheck, social life, weekends off. But when you escape, you enter a world that‚Äôs free but brutal. Freedom comes with wounds, sacrifices, and nights when it‚Äôs just you and your doubts.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù, it‚Äôs being alone in your thoughts. Your friends don‚Äôt get it, family nods politely, and even co-workers (if you have any) aren‚Äôt lying awake thinking about cash flow and churn. You carry that mental weight solo.\n\nThen come the sacrifices:\n\nFinancial ‚Üí You go from spending freely to questioning every expense.\n\nRejection ‚Üí Months of work, 50+ investor rejections, endless pivots.\n\nBias ‚Üí Judged on your passport, accent, gender, even your postcode.\n\nSide hustles ‚Üí Odd jobs, freelancing, hustling just to survive.\n\nBut you‚Äôre not actually alone. Many before you walked this road, and what waits at the end of the tunnel is worth it:\n\n1. Family that stood by you\n\n2. Financial freedom\n\n3. Physical freedom\n\n4. A transformed mindset\n\nAt that point, you realize what you really gave up was just time, a fraction of what you wasted in the cage.\n\nüí° TL;DR: Entrepreneurship is dark, lonely, and brutal, but you‚Äôre not the only one walking this road. The pain is the price of freedom.\n\nStay blessed, fellow founders. Shout out if you need someone who‚Äôs been there, plenty of us are carrying candles along the path.",

        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",
