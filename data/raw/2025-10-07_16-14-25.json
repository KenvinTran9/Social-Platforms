I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy.

Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this?

        "selftext": "I have a confession..\n\nFor years, I thought my problem was imposter syndrome. That voice saying \"you're a fraud, they're going to find you out.\" So I did what you're supposed to do: I worked harder. I over-delivered. I said yes to every client. I hired people to fill the gaps I was scared to admit I had. I chased the next win, thinking it would finally make me feel legitimate.\n\nAnd you know what happened? I became the \"successful\" CEO of a company I absolutely hated. I finally understood the real cost of imposter syndrome. It's not the anxiety. It's the life you build to try and quiet the anxiety. I was so busy trying to prove I was good enough that I built a business that had nothing to do with who I actually am.\n\nThe fix was realizing I had tied my worth to external outcomes (stuff I can't fully control) instead of my personal qualities, which I always can.\n\nOutcomes might get people in the door, but they rarely make people stay. What makes them stay is the real stuff: your integrity, your insight, how you handle a crisis.\n\nFor me, when I made that shift, sales calls stopped being high-stakes performances. They became simple alignment checks: \"Are we a true fit for each other?\" The pressure to \"beat\" competitors vanished. No one can compete with who you *are* at your core. They can only compete on the commoditized outcomes.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is building a prison and mistaking it for a legacy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Let me clarify the one thing I didn't make clear.\n\nThat \"prison\" business? I left it behind. I didn't fix it. I walked the fuck away and built something new from scratch (after a break). The new thing is the exact opposite: it runs on a different scale I mentioned above. I only do work that aligns with who I am. And the interesting part is that it's more profitable. \n\nI guess my original point got missed: this wasn't so much about work-life balance.. more about building a business that was literally designed by my insecurities. The workaholism was a symptom of building an entire life around proving I wasn't a fraud.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit. ",
