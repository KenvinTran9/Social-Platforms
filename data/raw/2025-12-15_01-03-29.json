        "selftext": "I've been the hired gun for dozens of founders over the years. I've seen who makes it and who burns out.\n\nAnd honestly? The ones who win are usually doing things that \"SaaS Twitter\" would scream at them for.\n\nHere is the controversial stuff I see the winners doing while everyone else is busy polishing their landing page.\n\n**1. They are \"technically\" incompetent (and proud of it)**\n\nThe worst founders I work with are the ones who know a little bit of code. They micromanage the stack. They argue about React vs. Vue. They want to know why I'm not using the latest Vercel feature.\n\nThe winners? They don't care.\n\nThey ask me: \"Can you build this by Friday?\"\nI say yes.\nThey say: \"Great. I'm going to go sell it.\"\n\nThey treat technology as a utility bill. They pay it, it works, they move on. They spend 100% of their brain power on sales, not on architecture diagrams.\n\n**2. They ignore \"scalability\" until it's actually on fire**\n\nI had a client whose backend was literally a single massive Python script running on a $5 DigitalOcean droplet. It was hideous. It crashed once a week.\n\nHe scaled that thing to $30k MRR before he let me refactor it.\n\nWhy? Because rewriting code doesn't make money. Selling makes money.\n\nMost of you are building for 100,000 users when you don't even have 10. The winners build for 10 users, let the server catch fire at 100, and then pay me to fix it with the money they made.\n\n**3. They are annoying**\n\nThe successful founders are the ones who text me at 8 PM on a Tuesday saying \"I just promised a customer this feature, can we hack it together by tomorrow?\"\n\nIt's annoying for me as a dev. But it works.\n\nThey aren't building a product roadmap for next year. They are closing the deal in front of them right now. They force the product to evolve based on real cash, not hypothetical user personas.\n\n**4. They don't have a \"vision\"**\n\nThe founders who fail always pitch me a \"platform.\" They want to be the \"OS for X.\"\n\nThe founders who win pitch me a tool. \"I want to make it easier for dentists to send appointment reminders.\"\n\nThat's it. No ecosystem. No API marketplace. Just a tool that does one boring thing and charges $50/month.\n\nThey don't try to change the world. They try to solve a minor inconvenience for a specific group of people with money.\n\n**5. They launch embarrassing products**\n\nIf you aren't ashamed of your MVP, you launched too late.\n\nI've launched products for clients that still had \"Lorem Ipsum\" on the about page. Buttons that didn't work. Mobile layouts that were broken.\n\nAnd people still bought them. Because the core utility was valuable enough that users forgave the jank.\n\nIf you are waiting for perfection, you are just procrastinating.\n\n**The hard truth**\n\nWe like to think SaaS success is about building a beautiful, scalable, well-architected software product.\n\nIt's not. It's about selling a solution to a problem.\n\nThe code is just the delivery mechanism. The sooner you treat it like a commodity and focus on the business, the sooner you'll actually make money.\n\nRoast me if you want, but this is what I've seen work.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",

It's science-backed (hormone tracking, sleep patterns, stress levels, cycle predictions/notifications), but I'm struggling with how much science to show users.\n\n**Dilemma:**\n\nI'm targeting a general relationship improvement niche, but displaying too much biology-related content (hormone names, technical terms, clinical calendar) doesn't seem like the right approach.\n\n**I see two paths:**\n\n1. Make it user-friendly -> Hide the biology, use relationship-focused language, target the broader relationship market (my preference)\n2. Lean into the science -> Keep biology terms, target biohackers/science-leaning users (smaller but more engaged niche)\n\nI want to go with option 1, but I need advice on how to balance credibility with accessibility.\n\n**What successful science-backed apps do (based on my research):**\n\nApps that hide the science:\n\n* MyFitnessPal - Shows calories/macros, zero research citations\n* Headspace - Minimal science, focuses on experience\n* Strava - Performance metrics, no research shown\n* Duolingo - Uses spaced repetition without explaining it and makes it fun\n\nApps that show some science:\n\n* Sleep Cycle - Basic sleep science in educational content\n* Ada (symptom checker) - References medical sources when explaining\n\n**The problem:**\n\n* Marketing says: \"Unlock your best relationship\", \"Fewer dumb arguments\", \"Understand each other's rhythms\"\n* Product feels like: Medical/period tracking app with some partner features\n* Users want: Relationship help, not biology lessons (**my assumption**)\n\n**Important context:**\n\nThe app tracks multiple metrics (sleep, stress, cycle, etc.) for both partners, and they can share this data with each other. The goal is to help couples understand the full picture of what affects each other's wellbeing, not to reduce anyone to a single biological factor or use it to explain away legitimate issues. It's about seeing the complete context of how both partners' rhythms interact.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Should I hide the biology/calendar behind relationship-focused language?\n2. Do successful consumer health apps show science, or just use it behind the scenes?\n3. Is showing hormone names/technical terms a retention killer for non-medical apps?\n4. Has anyone faced this? What's worked for you?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. I apologize for the long post but I had to make it as clear as possible.",
