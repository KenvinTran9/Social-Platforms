        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Its right on the water with a long dock and very beautiful\n\nWord has been getting around and last summer we started noticing people hanging around that weren't customers. One of our employees pointed out a camera. That's when we noticed a photographer and a couple were using our private dock for a photo shoot. I didn't really think anything of it.\n\nIt kept happening but what bothered me was it seemed like the photographers were being underhanded. They never asked for permission and would even pretend to be paying customers. They would pretend to look at things and then head out back. \n\nThen more photographers started coming. We had entire families dressed up for a shoot. Apparently word got out how pretty this place was for family pictures.\n\nI said something to one of the photographers and got an earful about how it's a public business that anyone  can access. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I dont want to be a hard ass but we aren't a huge operation and it's annoying as fuck to have all these extra people around not buying anything.",

        "selftext": "After testing multiple approaches, I've developed a method that consistently gets me 15 quality responses from 25 accepted connections. Here's the playbook:\n\nStep 1: Smart Targeting\n\nInstead of randomly hunting for prospects, leverage LinkedIn events as your source. Search for your industry keyword, hit the \"Events\" tab, and register for the most popular ones. This gives you access to a pre-qualified list of active participants in your space.  \n(you can also use [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai) to get high intent leads + do linkedIn outreach)\n\nPro tip: Focus on less senior profiles since they're typically more open to new solutions and respond more frequently.\n\nStep 2: The Connection Request (Desktop Only)\n\nKeep it simple and genuine: \"Hi \\[first name\\], noticed we're both in the \\[industry\\] space, would be great to connect!\"\n\nStep 3: Build Rapport Before Pitching\n\nOnce connected, wait 36 hours. If they post content, engage with a thoughtful comment (not just \"Great post!\").\n\nStep 4: The Message That Converts Instead of selling directly\n\nTake a consultative approach:\n\n* Briefly mention what you're building (1-2 lines max)\n* Ask about their daily challenges in their field\n* Propose a value exchange: their insights for early access or a discount\n\nThis approach transforms a cold pitch into a valuable conversation. Even if your product doesn't match their current needs, you gather insights to improve your offering or identify new use cases.\n\nBonus: Polish your profile with a clear photo and bio that tells your story.\n\nStop selling and start helping. The best sales conversations happen when you genuinely care about solving someone else's problems.\n\nGood luck !",
