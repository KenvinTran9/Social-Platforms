My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them. That's potentially lost revenue. Am I building a sustainable business or just being naive for saying the truth that actually helps?

We are going to be expanding this rule because of the continuous onslaught of people trying to use our subscribers as an unpaid market research group. That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

        "title": "We turned down a $1.5M VC offer for our SAAS",
        "selftext": "\"Thank you for the offer, but we’re going to stay bootstrapped.\"\n\nAbout a month and a half ago, a VC reached out saying they were looking for a SaaS like ours to invest in at seed stage.\n\nWe built [this SaaS](https://taap.it/m0jt3oT) in just 6 months, bootstrapped from day one, with over 350+ customers, and 40000+ monthly visitors.\n\nObviously, we were a bit suspicious at first. We did our homework, contacted founders they had already invested in, and everything turned out to be legit. They have some great startups in their portfolio.\n\nThey wanted to move fast with a seed round after due diligence, and we had a few weeks to think about it. Yesterday, we decided to turn it down, and here’s why.\n\nWe’re in a space that’s getting a lot of visibility, and our client results are strong.\n\nWe launched this SaaS just a few months ago, we have double-digit monthly growth, and we really feel the acceleration.\n\nThe VC needed a company in their portfolio specializing in intent signal data, because it’s a hot topic right now. One of our clients, who had raised funds with them, told them our tool was great, which is how they found us.\n\nRight now, we’re three cofounders and an assistant. We don’t even have employees yet !  \nSo when someone contacts you and says they want to wire you 1.5 million dollars, it definitely makes you think.\n\nHere’s how we approached the decision:\n\nWould it have accelerated our growth? Probably. We could hire faster, build faster, and enter new markets more quickly.\n\nBut there was also the other side, the one that made us really hesitate.\n\nIt means being accountable. A VC doesn’t give you money for free, they expect growth.\n\nThat means reporting, pressure, and not being able to do whatever you want anymore. There’s also preferential liquidity, which they mentioned.\n\nIf you sell the company, the VC gets their investment back before you see anything. If the company crashes and sells for 1.5 million, and they have a 1.5 million preference, we get zero.\n\nGiven our growth and what we believe we can achieve, that’s why we decided to refuse.\n\nAmong the founders, we said we would only raise if it’s with YCombinator. We’ve already been rejected once. This is now the second time we’re applying.\n\nAnother reason that pushed us to say no to the 1.5 million is that beyond the money, there didn’t seem to be strong marketing support from this VC. Some VCs bring you clients directly through their portfolio, which means immediate growth on top of the cash. That wasn’t the case here. Many of their portfolio companies weren’t aligned with our product at all.\n\nWhereas if YC joins your company and you target SMBs, it’s the holy grail. You’re almost guaranteed explosive growth in the months that follow.\n\nFor all these reasons, the pressure, the reporting, the meetings, the expectation to raise more money later, and the preferential liquidity clause, we decided to say no.\n\nWe’re lucky that the startup already pays the three cofounders, and we also have revenue streams from other businesses that run without us. So for now, we can afford to turn down outside money.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the story, and see you very soon!\n\nPs : My little gift to you, this is a free blueprint on [how you can reach 20kmrr ](https://www.notion.so/How-to-reach-10k-MRR-for-your-SAAS-286b9abcbe3f805fb469d503e584e172?source=copy_link)with your SAAS in a few months only.",

Go bigger. \"Think about what we could do with $1.5M.\"\n\nI want to stay bootstrapped. Keep it lean. Own 100% of what we're building. \"Think about what we keep if this works.\"\n\nWe've had this conversation 6 times in the last 2 months. Each time it gets more tense.\n\nHis argument: We're leaving opportunity on the table. Competitors are raising. Speed matters. We could capture market share now and optimize later.\n\nMy argument: We don't have product-market fit yet. Raising money won't fix that. It'll just give us more rope to hang ourselves with. We should hit $30K MRR bootstrapped before even considering it.\n\nNeither of us is wrong. We just have different risk tolerances and different visions.\n\nI don't know how this ends. Maybe we find a compromise. Maybe one of us buys the other out. Maybe we split.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about cofounders: early alignment on money, risk, and exit expectations matters more than complementary skills. You can hire for skills. You can't hire for aligned ambition.\n\nAnyone been through this? How did you resolve it?\n\n",
