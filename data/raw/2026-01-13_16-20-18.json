        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me.

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post.

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
