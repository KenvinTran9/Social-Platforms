        "selftext": "I've been the hired gun for dozens of founders over the years. I've seen who makes it and who burns out.\n\nAnd honestly? The ones who win are usually doing things that \"SaaS Twitter\" would scream at them for.\n\nHere is the controversial stuff I see the winners doing while everyone else is busy polishing their landing page.\n\n**1. They are \"technically\" incompetent (and proud of it)**\n\nThe worst founders I work with are the ones who know a little bit of code. They micromanage the stack. They argue about React vs. Vue. They want to know why I'm not using the latest Vercel feature.\n\nThe winners? They don't care.\n\nThey ask me: \"Can you build this by Friday?\"\nI say yes.\nThey say: \"Great. I'm going to go sell it.\"\n\nThey treat technology as a utility bill. They pay it, it works, they move on. They spend 100% of their brain power on sales, not on architecture diagrams.\n\n**2. They ignore \"scalability\" until it's actually on fire**\n\nI had a client whose backend was literally a single massive Python script running on a $5 DigitalOcean droplet. It was hideous. It crashed once a week.\n\nHe scaled that thing to $30k MRR before he let me refactor it.\n\nWhy? Because rewriting code doesn't make money. Selling makes money.\n\nMost of you are building for 100,000 users when you don't even have 10. The winners build for 10 users, let the server catch fire at 100, and then pay me to fix it with the money they made.\n\n**3. They are annoying**\n\nThe successful founders are the ones who text me at 8 PM on a Tuesday saying \"I just promised a customer this feature, can we hack it together by tomorrow?\"\n\nIt's annoying for me as a dev. But it works.\n\nThey aren't building a product roadmap for next year. They are closing the deal in front of them right now. They force the product to evolve based on real cash, not hypothetical user personas.\n\n**4. They don't have a \"vision\"**\n\nThe founders who fail always pitch me a \"platform.\" They want to be the \"OS for X.\"\n\nThe founders who win pitch me a tool. \"I want to make it easier for dentists to send appointment reminders.\"\n\nThat's it. No ecosystem. No API marketplace. Just a tool that does one boring thing and charges $50/month.\n\nThey don't try to change the world. They try to solve a minor inconvenience for a specific group of people with money.\n\n**5. They launch embarrassing products**\n\nIf you aren't ashamed of your MVP, you launched too late.\n\nI've launched products for clients that still had \"Lorem Ipsum\" on the about page. Buttons that didn't work. Mobile layouts that were broken.\n\nAnd people still bought them. Because the core utility was valuable enough that users forgave the jank.\n\nIf you are waiting for perfection, you are just procrastinating.\n\n**The hard truth**\n\nWe like to think SaaS success is about building a beautiful, scalable, well-architected software product.\n\nIt's not. It's about selling a solution to a problem.\n\nThe code is just the delivery mechanism. The sooner you treat it like a commodity and focus on the business, the sooner you'll actually make money.\n\nRoast me if you want, but this is what I've seen work.",
