If they say, “I want this rate,” and it still keeps me above my 20% margin line, I just say, “done.” No tricks, no drama, just exactly what they asked for.\n\nNow, 20% is the lower end of profit for software development, so technically I’m losing compared to what I could have earned. But here’s the strange part: about half of those clients come back with repeat work almost immediately, the rest circle back later in the year, and referrals pour in because people love telling their friends, “he gave me exactly what I asked for.”\n\nWhen I first started doing this, my wife would overhear me giving these discounts and critique it. Now she just smiles, because she knows I’m not actually losing, I’m buying loyalty.\n\nSometimes the fastest way to win is by losing.",

I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me.

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.
