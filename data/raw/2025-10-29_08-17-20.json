        "selftext": "\n\nI run a small residential roofing company (just me + 4 guys, doing around $40k/month) and there's one competitor who's always been our biggest rival in the area. We're cordial at supply shops but definitely competing for the same jobs.\n\nLast week I found out (through our shared insurance broker, long story) that they've been straight up lying to clients about having a general contractor's license. Like they claim to be \"fully licensed and insured\" on their website, truck wraps, everywhere. But they're not. At all. Never have been. I checked the state licensing board myself - nothing under their business name or the owner's name.\n\nThe kicker? Three of their current clients are homeowners I gave quotes to in the last 6 months and lost the job to them. One lady SPECIFICALLY told me she went with them because \"they seemed more legit with all their certifications\" and she felt safer. These are $15k-30k jobs btw.\n\nNow I'm sitting here like... do I say something? Part of me wants to send a \"hey just fyi\" message to those homeowners because like, if something goes wrong on their roof and the guy has no license, their homeowner's insurance might not cover it?? But another part of me feels like that's sketchy territory and I'll just look like a salty competitor trying to poach clients.\n\nMy lead guy says absolutely not, \"let karma handle it\" and it'll eventually blow up in their face anyway. My wife thinks I have a moral obligation to say something, especially since unlicensed work can void warranties and insurance claims.\n\nBut also like... they're literally breaking the law and winning contracts because of it. In our state you NEED a contractor's license for jobs over $10k. This isn't just shady, it's straight up illegal, right?\n\nThe thing that's really eating at me is one of those clients is an elderly couple on a fixed income who scraped together money for a roof replacement. They're getting scammed by someone who might leave them with zero recourse if something goes wrong. That one bugs me the most.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I'm losing sleep over this and honestly just need some outside perspective from people who get it.",

It adds 3 clicks to something doctors do 40 times a day. One cardiologist pulls out a spreadsheet proving the app will cost him $47k annually in lost patient time.\n\n2. Treat HIPAA like just another checkbox\n\nClick \"yes\" on a compliance form and genuinely believed that made the app secure and complaint. Learn about what it actually means in compliance review.\n\n3. Someone named O'Connor tried to log in\n\nEntire app crashes because some one forgot apostrophes exist in human names. The devs spend the next week learning about characters like Renée, Smith-Jones, and people whose entire legal name is just \"Cher.\"\n\n4. Show it to one doctor, product market fit confirmed.\n\n5. Epic wanted $25k just to have a conversation\n\nAssumed integration would be easy, Googled \"Epic integration\" and laughed at the $25k price tag, thinking it was a typo. It wasn't. Eight months later you get approval, and the app still crashes when it receives any data because integration testing is apparently a different $25k.\n\n9. AWS bill went from $500 to $15k, app hasn't launched yet\n\nTurns out HIPAA compliant infrastructure has opinions about encryption, logging,  and redundancy. Hospitals want you to sign SLA guaranteeing 4-nines. You hired a DevOps person at $12k/month because everything kept breaking and risk breaking the SLA. You've burned $220k and still don't have a single paying customer.\n\n10. They said \"this doesn't fit our workflow at all\" and you realized workflow was a word you should have learned earlier\n\nYou built scheduling. You built messaging. You built a beautiful patient portal. None of it maps to how clinicians actually work. They have to see 40 patients a day. Your app makes that harder, not easier. You spent a year solving problems nobody had while ignoring the ones they actually face daily.\n\n\nBut remember to have fun!",

The work is steady and ive built up a solid clientele the past 6 years. \n\nPart of the job sometimes involves getting calls from farmers ive never dealt with inquiring about my prices etc. Cue sketch ball McGee. (SB for short)\n\nI get a call from a farmer not in my territory, which was a red flag. My service isnt super unique. You travel and hour or two any direction and you find another of me thats happy to do the work. Why wasn't he calling them?\n\nSays he cant get anyone to spread ag lime for him. Red flag #2. Has 120 acres he wants a whopping 4 tons to the acre. (Note, 1-2 tons an acre is most common, 3 is max if the ph is awful). \nI say sure ill do whatever you want. Asks for a quote, get him one, $30 a ton for purchasing the lime, trucking and spreading. $120/acre. He says sure sounds good. Start anytime. \n\nNow normally with my usual farmers this is no big deal. I spread, pay all the inputs, then bill them for all materials plus my time on top. Never had an issue. But something was off with him, but at the same time if he was real this was a big profit job. My dad whose much wiser than me told me to ask him for half up front. \"Tell him this is standard procedure with new clients.\" So I did. Dude said ok ill get back you. Never heard from again. Dodged a bullet i think. \n\nNow I know why no one in his area would work with him. ",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

If even the Google co-founder is saying you can’t start the next big thing without massive capital anymore, what does that mean for tech entrepreneurship? Is it still the best path to create wealth, or has it been replaced by something else? I always thought tech was special because you could start with nothing and build something huge, but maybe those days are over?

Three entire months of shipping features, fixing bugs, posting on Twitter to crickets, and wondering if I was delusional.\n\nThat first $29 payment notification hit different. Not because of the money, but because it proved the concept wasn't just in my head.\n\n## Validation Tools Are More Valuable Than You Think\n\nThe app is a research platform that helps people validate ideas before building them. Sounds boring, right?\n\nThat's exactly why it works.\n\nEveryone wants to build the next viral AI tool. Almost nobody wants to do the unsexy work of researching if anyone actually has the problem they're trying to solve.\n\nI built this because I wasted months on projects nobody wanted. Turns out, a lot of other builders have the same problem.\n\n## The Pricing Mistake That Cost Me 2 Months\n\nI launched at $9/month because I was scared nobody would pay more.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThe people who paid $9 were tire kickers. They'd sign up, use it once, then churn. My revenue looked like a yo yo.\n\nI changed pricing to $29/month (and added a $99 tier). Lost half my customers. Revenue doubled. The people who stayed actually used the product and gave real feedback.\n\nLesson: Cheap pricing attracts cheap customers.\n\n## What Actually Drives Growth (Not What Twitter Says)\n\nI tried everything:\n- Twitter threads (12 likes, 0 conversions)\n- Product Hunt launch (ranked #47, got 8 customers who churned)\n- Reddit ads ($200 spent, 2 signups, both canceled)\n\nWhat actually worked:\n- Reddit posts in r/Entrepreneur and r/SaaS (not promotional, just genuinely helpful)\n- Solving specific use cases (added Reddit research tools, App Store analysis)\n- Word of mouth from people who actually got value\n\nGrowth isn't sexy. It's answering the same questions 50 times in different subreddits until someone finally checks out your product.\n\n## The Features That Matter vs The Ones You Think Matter\n\nI spent 3 weeks building a beautiful dashboard with charts and graphs. Users opened it once.\n\nI spent 2 hours adding a \"copy to clipboard\" button for research results. People use it constantly and mention it in testimonials.\n\nUsers don't care about your architecture or your fancy UI animations. They care about getting their job done 5 minutes faster.\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth About Competition\n\nWhen I started, there were already 10+ idea validation tools. I almost didn't launch because \"the market is saturated.\"\n\nReality: Most of those tools are abandoned side projects or have terrible UX.\n\nThe real competition isn't other validation tools. It's the manual process people already use (scrolling Reddit for hours, reading hundreds of app reviews).\n\nYour competition is the status quo, not other startups.\n\n## What $1k/Month Actually Means\n\nIt covers my AWS bill, domain renewals, and maybe half my rent.\n\nBut more importantly:\n- It proves people will pay for this\n- It funds more development\n- It gives me leverage to quit my day job eventually\n- It proves I can build something profitable\n\nThe goal isn't to stay at $1k. It's to prove the model works at small scale before scaling.\n\n## Next Milestones\n\nGetting to $3k/month: Need 100 paying customers at $29/mo average\nGetting to $10k/month: Need better enterprise features for teams\n\nNot going to pretend I have all the answers. Still figuring out most of this. But if you're stuck at $0 trying to hit your first dollar, these lessons might save you a few months.\n\nI interviewed some people and here is my app [Dev box](https://bigideasdb.com)\n\n",
