Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense.

Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost.

Recently a women made a post on a local facebook group with about 26,000 members slamming our store, saying we are rude, didn’t take her clothes, etc. While we do love constructive criticism this post was full of lies and complaints that are all adressed in the contract are make every consigner sign before bringing anything in. The post blew up with tons of angry people complaining about how we were to picky and didn’t take there clothes. If anyone has been in the consignment business you would know how picky you have to be bc space is limited and extremely valuable. Anyways she denied signing any contract in her post which was completely false as we physically have a copy of her contract with the signature dating all the way back to 2014. On top of this she used credit on account multiple times meaning she knew she had an account in order to use the money in it. My question is how to handle the situation. Publicly out the woman with evidence of the lying or let it brush over. ",

Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me.

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.
