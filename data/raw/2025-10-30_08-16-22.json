        "selftext": "Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit of regret about leaving my job. I know it was the right decision at the time since it was really affecting my confidence and mental health (due to toxic coworker). Still, I wish I had found better ways to cope with the stress back then or ways to manage it better so I could’ve kept that stable monthly income.\n\nBuilding a business now has been even more challenging for my mental health and confidence. But I know this is what I really want to do than work for someone else's dream. But it’s hard, especially when you’re surrounded by people with steady jobs. You start feeling like you’re missing out or doing something wrong, even when you’re not. It’s definitely a bit of FOMO.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that I will never leave a job again without a backup plan, no matter how much I have saved. I really thought I’d be fine living off my savings for a while that can sustain me for a year or two, but it’s different when you don’t have that regular income. I end up feeling lost, distracted, and constantly doubting myself, questioning whether I’m doing the right thing.\n\nI used to think that working on my own business full time would help me focus more, since having a job seemed like a distraction. But in reality, the pressure of doing your own thing without seeing results quickly can be overwhelming. Maybe I just need to build a stronger mindset, be more patient, be consistent, practice delayed gratification, but looking back, even during my school days, I was never great at working under pressure - and working on building a business full time is a whole lot of pressure.\n\nHas anyone else left a stable job to chase their dream, only to find it’s way harder than you expected?\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences and any lessons you learned along the way.",

The work is steady and ive built up a solid clientele the past 6 years. \n\nPart of the job sometimes involves getting calls from farmers ive never dealt with inquiring about my prices etc. Cue sketch ball McGee. (SB for short)\n\nI get a call from a farmer not in my territory, which was a red flag. My service isnt super unique. You travel and hour or two any direction and you find another of me thats happy to do the work. Why wasn't he calling them?\n\nSays he cant get anyone to spread ag lime for him. Red flag #2. Has 120 acres he wants a whopping 4 tons to the acre. (Note, 1-2 tons an acre is most common, 3 is max if the ph is awful). \nI say sure ill do whatever you want. Asks for a quote, get him one, $30 a ton for purchasing the lime, trucking and spreading. $120/acre. He says sure sounds good. Start anytime. \n\nNow normally with my usual farmers this is no big deal. I spread, pay all the inputs, then bill them for all materials plus my time on top. Never had an issue. But something was off with him, but at the same time if he was real this was a big profit job. My dad whose much wiser than me told me to ask him for half up front. \"Tell him this is standard procedure with new clients.\" So I did. Dude said ok ill get back you. Never heard from again. Dodged a bullet i think. \n\nNow I know why no one in his area would work with him. ",

Fast forward 8 months and we've spent probably 80k on implementation consultants, our finance team has been basically useless this entire time because they're drowning in configuration meetings, we STILL don't have it fully set up and half our team refuses to use it correctly because it's so goddamn complicated for basic tasks   \nIMO I think ERP only makes sense when you are a manufacturing company with complex supply chains and inventory and whatever but for a saas startup it's kinda useless. We're paying sales people buying software subscriptions and occasionally ordering laptops. Why do we need enterprise resource planning for that? The worst part is everyone's too proud to admit it was a mistake at this point and we're stuck with it.

Scary as hell because i didn't have established clients and wasn't trying to start a whole agency with overhead and employees.\n\nFound a marketplace model where i could access companies that were already looking for recruiters. Started taking roles in my specialty (devops and platform engineering), and focused on actually placing people instead of doing business development.\n\nMonth 1-3 was slow. Made maybe 4k total because i was still learning how to work independently and building reputation on the platform.\n\nMonth 4-8 started clicking. Placed 2-3 people per month, income jumped to 15-20k monthly.\n\nMonth 9-18 has been consistent. Averaging 18k per month, placed 31 people total. Some months are 25k, some are 12k, but it averages out.\n\nWhat's different: i work 30 hours a week instead of 50. I only take roles i actually want to work on. No more weekly team meetings or having to hit arbitrary quotas. I pick my own schedule.\n\nDownsides: no benefits, have to figure out my own health insurance and retirement. Income can swing month to month. Some months i don't place anyone.\n\nWould i go back? Absolutely not. Even with the uncertainty, making 3x what i made before and controlling my time is worth it.",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

If even the Google co-founder is saying you can’t start the next big thing without massive capital anymore, what does that mean for tech entrepreneurship? Is it still the best path to create wealth, or has it been replaced by something else? I always thought tech was special because you could start with nothing and build something huge, but maybe those days are over?
