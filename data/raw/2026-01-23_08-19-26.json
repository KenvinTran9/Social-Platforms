        "selftext": "Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

        "title": "Boss offering to sell me the coffee shop I work at for $65k — does this sound reasonable on the surface?",
        "selftext": "So I’ve worked at a small waffle and coffee shop for about 3 years. It’s a small operation in downtown of a large city. The owner recently offered to sell me the business for $65,000. His reasoning is that he wants to free up capital to put into another business he’s scaling, and he feels comfortable passing this one on to me since I already run much of the day-to-day. They’re hardly there in person at this point, maybe once a month or every other month to collect the cash. We’re located in a small food hall under an office building, so there’s a constant supply of costumers from there. Not enough to keep our numbers where we want, but it helps make sure we’re never actually dead I think. We’re also located right by the theatre district so whenever there’s ballet shows or operas it guarantees some traffic. The rent is also taken by the food hall as a percentage of our sales so whenever it’s slow we don’t get hurt too badly. Another factor maybe worth considering is that we partnered with Starbucks, so we buy their products and can sell them, something he already paid the license for.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n•\tMonthly sales usually fall between $5k–$7k per week. Highs of 8k+\n\n•\tAverage month is around $30-35k. Busy months can get close to $40k, slowest (usually just January) is around 25\n\n•\tHe claims the business nets about $3k–$4k in profit per month\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\n•\tOn the surface, does a $65k asking price sound reasonable given those numbers?\n\n•\tWhat specific documents should I ask to see before even considering this seriously?\n\n•\tWhat questions should I be asking about expenses, lease terms, debt, equipment, etc.?\n\n•\tWhat are common things first-time buyers overlook in situations like this?\n\nI’m not rushing into anything — just trying to educate myself before I say yes or no. I appreciate any insight from people who’ve bought or sold small businesses before.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit : I’ve seen it brought up and forgot to mention originally, but equipment is rented from the food hall so we don’t pay for repairs.\n\nThis was a bit of a passion project originally for the owners, but they’ve been too busy with their other jobs and their family to dedicate the time theyd like to it. I have a great relationship with them and consider them friends at this point. All the other owners of the stalls in this food hall are personally here most if not every day, but it’s been a point of pride for me to manage this place without them needing to be here. We have a small team but everyone’s awesome and covers whenever needed\n\nThe 3-4k profit would be after all expenses, including my current wages and inventory. There’s also ways to save money, for example they spend a ton on delivery for ingredients since theyre too busy to go to the store themselves.\n\nAlso this is not a franchise.",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "I started working on a small side project a few months ago with the idea that I’d slowly grow it and see where it goes. Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",
