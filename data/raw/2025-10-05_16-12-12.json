        "selftext": "I arrived in SF three days ago and wanted to test a build in public experiment. Like really in public, in a cafe. I sat at Blue Bottle from 7am to 1pm with a sign on my laptop that read ‚Äúcoffee on me for valuable feedback.‚Äù It worked, people smiled, and I met a lot of interesting folks, including investors and founders. I have a post from this morning with an image of how it looked, I can share if you ask for it, I cannot attach it here. This is what I learned:\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* 7:00 to 9:00 quiet time, a few good chats\n* around 9:00 biggest rush, I could not keep up with follow-ups and quick demos\n* 10:45 to 12:15 dead time\n* 12:15 to 13:00 rush again\n* left at 13:00 when the battery died\n\n**Numbers:**\n\n* 121 people looked at the sign, only the ones I noticed and counted. Possibly it was 2 to 3 times higher.\n* 17 conversations, about 25 people total since some came in pairs\n* 14 new LinkedIn and Twitter connections\n* 3 VCs connections\n* 3 founder connections\n* 0 coffees bought by me\n\n**Conversion**\n\n17 conversations out of 121 sign views, about 14 percent. I likely missed many glances, if real views were closer to twice that, call it around 7 to 8 percent. Also, it helps if you notice and start the conversation first, then people approach you. I think 3 VCs is very good number. will see how it goes from here.\n\nWhat it felt like in practice, I was sitting on the other side of the register, facing it, so many people ordered first, then while they waited for their coffee, they noticed the sign and maybe we talked. Lots of mobile pickup, many did not stop. Sign placement was not ideal, you had to turn from the deck to see it, but it was still the best seat I could get. Net result, it was a very productive time, even though actual coding was tough during the rush. If you try this, please buy something from the cafe, and if you stay long, consider buying more than once. I asked the staff if the sign was okay, and they said it was totally fine, so big thanks to this cafe.\n\nNow I am at home to keep building my startup. Good luck to anyone building or fundraising out there!\n\n\n\nWhat else should I try next time?",

Mileage, cost of goods, you name it. Some of these are expenses, some aren't.\n\nIf regularly employed folks were allowed to deduct their meals, mileage, cell phone bill, work uniforms, etc then their income would appear lower as well.  \n\nBut they still only look at adjusted gross income or AGI. \n\nEven if you made $70,000 and only had $20,000 in actual expenses, but legally wrote off another $30k in deductions (just an example), your AGI is only $20,000 which isn't very much.\n\nIf you took home $70k working for a company, but spent $20k on travel expenses, mileage, meals, cell phone, internet, uniforms, work shoes, tools, you name it, the bank STILL only looks at that $70k figure.\n\nHow on earth is that fair? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I'm a freelance video editor and I‚Äôve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not sure how to break the cycle.\n\nThis is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100‚Äì$200), but the work always expands ‚Äî feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I‚Äôve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I‚Äôm burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I‚Äôll be better,\" but then‚Ä¶ same thing.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it‚Äôs like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I‚Äôll start soon ‚Äî until it‚Äôs too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don‚Äôt want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I‚Äôm open to anything.",
