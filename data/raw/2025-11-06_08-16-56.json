        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "I've come to firmly believe - after more than one attempt - that this is by far the worst time to build a startup. Anyone claiming otherwise is lying in plain sight, and I am sick of reading about these lies every now and then.\n\nSure, tools make building easier: AI, \"vibe coding\" and so on.\n\nBut that's exactly what’s killing startups. It's now almost impossible to build a moat. Every product-market fit (difficult per se to find in a solutions over-saturated world) turns into a red ocean in the blink of an eye.\n\nBefore you even manage to build an MVP and get early traction, ten other ventures are already doing the same thing - burning money and making any roadmap to profitability useless.\n\nThe only remaining way to build a moat is through distribution (and distribution only, while it used to be a mix) - and that’s the most plutocratic asset of all. Those who already have customers have money, and those with money can afford to lose more of it, for longer, even in a red ocean.\n\nTo some extent, this has always been true. But now it's 10x, maybe 100x worse.\n\nNewcomers’ efforts are fragmented; they never reach the critical mass to become something meaningful. In the best-case scenario, they get acquired early by incumbents just to speed up existing processes - so nobody really profits from the initial risk.\n\nAs a \"job\" when you weigh risks and opportunities, building startups is becoming less and less viable.\n\nIs that a sterile complaint? Yes.\n\nIs it wrong? You tell me.",

        "selftext": "\nMy business partner and I run a social media content  agency (2 years old, 17 active clients). One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent <20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

        "title": "How to raise money from VCs at pre-seed. Don’t. <I will not promote>",
        "selftext": "Stop chasing VC money at pre-seed, if you are not prepared. It’s a waste of time.\n\nIn my first startup we raised money from Sequoia, Techstars and SkyDeck. But before that, we wasted the first six months trying to convince investors with nothing to show, just a website and some nice words.\n\nAfter going through several accelerators and meeting hundreds of founders, I realized one thing: raising money too early is one of the biggest mistakes you can make.\n\nAt the pre-seed stage, VCs care about four things:\n\n**Experience**. They want a team with real experience in the field. Not just smart people, but people who understand the industry deeply.\n\n**Traction**. They want to see real growth, something that proves people actually care about what you are building.\n\n**Credibility**. They want to invest in startups that can convince other investors too.\n\n**Progress**. If a VC asks you to keep them updated, do it. It shows that you can set goals and reach them.\n\nNow let’s destroy some myths:\n\n* VCs are not attracted by ideas. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.\n* VCs are not your friends, even if they smile and follow you on LinkedIn. They invest because they expect a return.\n* VCs are not necessarily looking for profitable startups. They are looking for startups that can be sold. The exit is what matters, which means reaching the next round.\n\nAnd about the pitch deck, it will never raise money by itself. It is just a business card to get a meeting. Focus on clarity and content, not fancy design. YC’s guidelines are still the best reference. Keep it short, direct and free of meaningless buzzwords.\n\nHere are some hard truths most founders learn too late.\n\nThe money you raise is not your money. You will not get rich from funding rounds. In most cases your salary will be the lowest in the company.\n\nFunding is debt. It is high risk, but still debt. No one gives you money for free.\n\nVC's money are for growth, not validation.\n\nThe only reason to raise is to grow faster, not to prove that your idea works.\n\nAnd raising a lot does not mean you are successful. Sometimes it only means you are good at selling dreams. I have seen CEOs raise millions with no traction, no experience and just confidence. They looked arrogant, overly self assured, and VCs loved it. Especially if they were young.\n\nBut success means building a company that creates value for customers and generates real revenue from that. It means reaching break even and becoming self sustaining.\n\nRemember, raising more money often means getting further from profitability.\n\nBefore chasing investors, ask yourself:\n\n* Is my team experienced enough for this industry?\n* Are we credible for the next round? \n* Is my idea already validated?\n* Do I really need to grow fast?\n\nIf your answer sounds like any of these, stop now:\n\nI need money for myself.  \nI need money to validate the idea.  \nI need money to convince my cofounder.  \nI need money to hire someone to build it.  \nI need money to prove the project works.\n\nAnd the worst of all:  \nI need money to get rich.\n\n**Did you ever feel like trying to raise money from VCs was pointless? Why?**",

        "selftext": "I'm a local business in Chicago owning an IT company that does website designs, AI integration, Cybersecurity, and helping backups and backend of a business. A B2B business. How do y'all market, the fact this is an entire different sector and so frustrating the amount of hours it takes to learn. I have finally decided it would be better to just hire someone. I'm even thinking to use some of those crazy AI videos for visuals using those new softwares that are coming out. And where do I even look for good marketers, most of my business comes from referrals. I just want a consistent system that brings in leads every week. My work speaks for itself I just need to work for it to speak. I applaud all of your marketing experts honestly because after 4 calls with people on Fiverr I might have lost hope. ",
