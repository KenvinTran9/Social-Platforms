The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "It's a dumb question. You're not dumb, just maybe uninformed, which I will rectify shortly. But the question is very, very dumb.\n\nFirst off, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" are really asking \"how can I make a lot of money?\"\n\nStraight up, starting a business is a crappy way to make a lot of money. Statistically most people lose money. You're probably going to lose money. So, if you want to make a lot of money, get into management consulting or ibanking, which generally means getting an MBA. Have fun with that.\n\nSecondly, people who ask \"what business should I start?\" generally think that businesses are fungible, which means they're a commodity or easily swapped out with one another. This, btw, is why most businesses fail. Because people think that businesses are just this thing that you start and money comes out the other end.\n\nIf I said a great business is rolling up a bunch of dentist practices, would you know what to do with that? Like, do you have dentistry experience? Do you have PE experience rolling up companies? If the answer is no to both, don't fucking roll up a bunch of dentist practices. It requires skills you don't have.\n\nIf I said, \"ooh! ooh! ooh! AI, baby! AI is gonna change everything,\" are you especially good at AI? If you're not, then one school of thought would say that AI is a growing market, so you should learn AI and sell those services to other people. There's another school of thought that says every fucking person and their grandmother is learning AI right now so they can sell  services to other people and I really wonder what you are going to discover about AI that's going to make you better than my grandma.\n\nLastly, markets aren't interchangeable either.\n\nI spent nearly 30 years starting tech companies. Had a few successes and a bunch of failures. Now, I'm a world-class startup coach. I do that job exceptionally well, I have great word of mouth, make a lot of money. And when I started, I knew A LOT of people in several startup ecosystems. My access to that market helped me get off the ground and eventually scale this business.\n\nIf I decided to start a company selling shit to celebrities, I would fail. I would 100% fail. Why? I don't know any celebrities. I don't have access to that market and I'd probably run out of money and time before I figured out how to get celebrities' attention.\n\nStop asking what business you should start. They aren't lego bricks.\n\nHere's a much better question to ask yourself: what do I love to do?\n\nFind something you love to do. Get good at it. Prove that you're good at it by selling your services to other people, either as an employee or a contractor. Get promoted and get a great title. Or become a consultant, which is just a contractor who charges a shit ton of money.\n\nGet so good at what you love that you know things about your job and market that no one else knows about. Understand secrets about your industry that give you a fundamentally unfair advantage over everyone else. Even my grandmother.\n\nThen go start a business using that knowledge. That's the business you should start.\n\nEDIT: random spelling and grammatical errors. I type for shit.",

        "title": "I got played by a business couple connected to a huge influencer and it is embarrassing how much I believed their promises",
        "selftext": "This is based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 \n\nI am not mentioning names because I do not want legal issues, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nA while ago I started providing cleaning services for a couple who owned an Airbnb. The husband acted like a big entrepreneur and constantly talked up his plans. His wife was an influencer with millions of followers. I barely ever spoke to her and she never communicated with me, but he kept bringing her up as if her follower count meant their business was legitimate.\n\nHis business partner was a realtor and the two of them acted like they were on the verge of building a large real estate empire. They told me they were buying 13 properties in Orlando and said I would get all the cleaning contracts. I run a cleaning agency and handle hiring, interviews, scheduling and operations, but I still let their hype get to me.\n\nLooking back, it is embarrassing how much I believed them.\n\nThey pushed me to lower my prices and told me I would make more long term because of the volume they would bring. Lower rates meant cleaners made less money and did not want to work their job, which caused constant staffing issues. They did not care. They just wanted cheaper labor.\n\nThey nitpicked everything. Small towel marks, tiny smudges, anything they could point to. One time four towels were slightly dirty. Instead of washing them, he ordered more than two hundred dollars worth of towels and cloths without asking and then made me pay him back for the order. He acted like he was helping me by explaining how to claim the HST.\n\nHe often acted friendly and gave me advice as if he was mentoring me, then switched into being demanding and controlling. The most insulting thing he said was, “You should not run a cleaning business if you are not a cleaner.” I run a real agency. I am educated and I manage the business. I do not need to personally scrub toilets to operate a company. His comment showed he did not respect what I built.\n\nSomething important is that during this time I kept asking him about Orlando. I told him I was planning to open a branch there. I told him I was hiring people. He knew I was taking the opportunity seriously and believed what he said. Despite that he kept lying about the 13 houses and the future work. He watched me prepare for something that did not exist.\n\nEventually my only Hamilton cleaner quit and after more than thirty hours of interviewing and reviewing applications I realized the entire situation was a dead end. Their budget did not match their expectations and every cleaner disliked going there. The promises were never real.\n\nI finally sent a formal message ending the relationship and telling them I would no longer be providing cleaning services. They never replied. No thank you. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nThat silence told me everything.\n\nHere is the interesting part. Because of their constant talk about Orlando, I actually opened a branch there. I hired people and started operating. And somehow it worked. I am now running my agency in Orlando and so far it has been more successful than what I had in Hamilton. I never would have considered Orlando if it was not for their story, even though their own plans were fake.\n\nSo in a strange way, something good did come out of this. I just had to learn the hard way that not everyone who talks big is telling the truth.\n\nHere is what I learned:\n\nPeople connected to influencers are not automatically professional or honest.\nPeople who promise future opportunities often want discounts today.\nFriendly behavior does not mean respect.\nAnyone who tries to devalue your work is not a partner and never will be.\nSometimes walking away is the best business decision you can make.\n\n\n\n\nForgot to add:\n\nThe biggest red flag I ignored was the fact that they dropped their long time cleaner for my company. No warning to her, nothing. They just kicked her out to start using me. She was really good to them from what I heard & only had a minor scheduling issue. Also, the main guy I was dealing with lied to me that “guests are refusing to pay the higher cleaning fee” when he never updated the cleaning fee on Airbnb from $120 to $200 (which is what I charged him). I know this because I checked the listing every day for new reviews. So that was also a ploy to get me to lower the cleaning fee… I’m probably forgetting some things.",
