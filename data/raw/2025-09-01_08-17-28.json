        "selftext": "My last post here about side hustles absolutely blew up and is the 2nd top post in r/entrepreneur this year! Thanks guys!!!\n\nAfter that post blew up, my DMs got flooded with questions specifically about making money with AI.\n\ngiven the interest, i scraped another 25K+ comments across social media to see which AI tools are actually making people money or saving time.\n\nThis time grok and gpt 5 deep research were used to analyze the data. Scraped from YouTube, Facebook Groups, Instagram, TikTok, X and Reddit.\n\nHere‚Äôs the list:\n\n1. Beautiful AI - make professional slideshows in just a few clicks. People report saving tons of time and there are even those who sell a service of redesigning ugly slideshows and are using this to do the work.\n\n2. Suno AI - make insane quality music in just seconds. People are making jingles for companies. Others are making songs, releasing them through DistroKid, then earning royalties from Spotify and streamers.\n\n3. Vubo AI - make viral worthy vertical videos in under a minute. People run faceless channels and earn through Adsense and sponsorships. Others use the video templates to make viral videos to promote their digital products or affiliate offers.\n\n4. Browse AI - scrape and monitor websites without coding. Marketers are using it to build lead lists, researchers are selling data reports, and ecom owners are tracking competitor pricing automatically.\n\n5. Chatbase - make a custom AI chatbot trained on your own data. Freelancers are selling ‚Äúdone-for-you‚Äù chatbots to businesses that want 24/7 customer support, while solopreneurs use it to have world class customer support and boost sales.\n\n6. Instantly AI - send high-converting cold email campaigns that land in the inbox with ease. Some people sell done-for-you outreach as a service or use cold email to sell affiliate offers or generate leads which they sell to businesses.\n\n7. OpusClip - cut long videos into shorts and easily add subtitles. People use this to turn podcasts or long form video into tons of TikToks, shorts and reels. Video editors also sell clipping as a service to influencers and businesses.\n\n8. Indexly AI - submits your new or updated pages to Google and Bing so they get indexed in hours instead of weeks. Bloggers and ecom stores use it to grab traffic fast, while SEO freelancers resell ‚Äúrapid indexing‚Äù as a service.\n\n9. Fireflies AI - automatically record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings. People use it to create detailed call notes and many report it makes them way more efficient.\n\n10. TryAtria - get ad inspiration from 25m winning ads, write better ad copy, and see what‚Äôs working right now. People use this to research competitors and create ad campaigns that convert better.\n\n11. Higgsfield AI - turn photos into videos with cool video effects, generate ultra realistic people, make avatars that speak, and lots more. Basically a creative suite for marketers, creators and beyond.\n\n12. StealthGPT AI - write human copy that is undetectable as AI and sounds like you. Many people report using this on school assignments, at work, and even in copywriting for their business. Many mentions in recent months.\n\nim sure some are missing so feel free to share your own ways to save time or make money using AI. If you guys find this post useful I will post a follow up next month.",

        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.
