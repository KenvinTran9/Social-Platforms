        "selftext": "Got an email a few months ago. The CEO of my biggest competitor wanted to chat. Assumed it was a trick or a scouting mission. Took the call anyway out of curiosity. They wanted to buy me. Real offer. Real number. Not life-changing money but meaningful. I didn't take it. But the process of considering it taught me a ton. They asked questions I'd never asked myself. What percentage of customers actually use the core feature? What's the real competitive moat? How replaceable am I personally to the business? What would break if I disappeared? What assets transfer versus what's just me? Had to actually find the answers. Some were uncomfortable. The moat I thought existed basically didn't. Turns out competitors could rebuild my product in 3-4 months. The thing I thought was defensible was just a head start. My personal involvement was more central than I'd admitted. Relationships I had with key customers, knowledge in my head, reputation I'd built. The business without me was worth a lot less than I assumed. But I also discovered strengths I'd undersold. Customer retention was higher than I realized. A segment I thought was small was actually growing fast. The word of mouth in a specific niche was stronger than any marketing I'd done. The acquisition didn't happen but the clarity was worth more than the offer. Highly recommend pretending someone wants to buy you and asking yourself the hard questions. You'll learn a lot. What would you discover if someone tried to acquire you?",

Seemed helpful. I thought I was lucky to have access to someone with his experience.\nThen I noticed something. Every few months he'd ask if I knew other founders in my space. Said he wanted to \"help them too.\" I'd make introductions feeling good about connecting people.\nA founder I'd introduced him to reached out one day. Asked why I hadn't mentioned my mentor was an investor in their competitor. I had no idea what she was talking about.\nDid some digging. Over those 18 months he'd invested in three companies in my space. All introduced to him by me or discovered through our conversations. He had a complete map of my market, my weaknesses, where I was headed, what I was worried about. And he'd used it to inform his investments in my competitors.\nI felt sick. Every conversation replayed in my head. Every time I'd been open about a struggle, I was probably giving him information that helped him evaluate companies that would compete with me.\nWhen I confronted him he didn't even deny it. Just said \"that's how the game works\" and seemed confused why I was upset.\nMaybe I'm naive. Maybe this is normal. But I trusted someone who was extracting value while pretending to give it.\nNow I'm much more careful about mentors who are also investors. The incentives aren't always aligned.\nAnyone else been burned by a mentor?\n",

I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast.

APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though.

Thirty cents.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - everyone acts like setting up GCP or AWS is some dark art that requires a PhD. It's not. With modern CI/CD, it's stupidly simple. I spent literally 30 minutes following a Medium guide and had everything deployed. Now with Claude and Cursor, you can basically vibe your way through cloud configurations.\n\nI'm not saying these tools provide zero value.
