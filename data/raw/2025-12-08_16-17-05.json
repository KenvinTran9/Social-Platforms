But the math gets complicated.\nWhat I noticed:\nSupport load exploded. Tire-kickers asking questions about things they'd never pay for.\nTrial abuse appeared. People creating multiple accounts to extend free usage forever.\nSales calls became less qualified. More \"just looking around\" conversations.\nThe 15% who converted were often lower-intent. Higher churn in first 90 days.\nWhat I tried next:\nCredit card required, but no charge for 14 days. Clear messaging \"you won't be charged until day 15.\"\nResults:\nSignups: 89 per month (down from 186, up from 40)\nConversion rate: 31%\nNet new customers: ~28\nSame absolute customers, but better quality. Lower support load. Less abuse.\nThe right answer depends on your product:\nHigh-touch, complex product? Credit card upfront. Filters to serious buyers.\nSimple, self-serve product? No credit card. Volume matters more.\nMiddle ground? Credit card required with very clear \"no charge until X\" messaging.\nThere's no universal best practice. Test both and measure net new paying customers, not just signup rates.\nWhat's your trial signup flow?",

Keeps saying stuff like \"I feel like an employee in my own startup\". Which… idk, maybe sorta fair? He’s at 35% equity. But I’ve been the one doing all the fundraising, sales, ops, support, marketing, you name it.\n\nThis morning I wake up to 47 Slack messages. He rage quit last night, forked the entire repo to his personal GitHub, and sent an email to a few of our paying customers saying he’s the real founder and that he’s \"starting fresh without the baggage\". Then he deleted himself from our Slack.\n\nOur dev team is freaking out. Investors are texting me \"wtf happened?\" and I’m somewhere between panic and laughter at this point.\n\nAnyway, lawyers are now involved.. Has anyone else ever had a cofounder go nuclear like this? Is there any coming back from this, or is it just scorched earth and move on?\n\nPosting from a throwaway account here... sorry guys. I'm actually quite active on my regular account and I think I've seen a eerily similar story here a while back (an omen?) but I can't seem to find it anymore to see what the advice was.",

He said no.\n\nHis reason was simple:  \n**“Why give up 22% of my company for capital we’re not even using?”**\n\nAnd he’s right.\n\nHere’s the problem with VC math:\n\n* VCs need huge exits to make their fund returns work\n* That pushes every startup toward “unicorn or nothing”\n* Even if a $60M exit would change the founder’s life\n\nI’ve worked with many startups that raised money.  \nThe uncomfortable truth? **Most would’ve been better off without it.**\n\nHere’s a common story:\n\nA company raises $7M at a $28M valuation.  \nThey grow to $15M revenue and get a $55M acquisition offer.  \nThe founders want to sell.  \nThe board says no — the exit isn’t big enough for the fund.\n\nSo they push for more growth.  \nThe market shifts.  \nThe company burns out.  \nThe founders walk away with nothing.\n\nIf they had bootstrapped and kept 75%?  \nThat same $55M exit would’ve put **$41M** in their pocket.\n\nSmart founders in 2025 are thinking like this:\n\n* Bootstrap to $6M ARR → Sell for $60M → Keep \\~$48M vs.\n* Raise VC → Own 35% → Need a $140M exit to make the same amount\n\nAnd that’s assuming you even get the exit — **80% don’t.**\n\nVC only makes sense for a few types of companies:\n\n* Capital-heavy businesses (hardware, deeptech, biotech)\n* Winner-take-all markets\n* Founders aiming for a $10B+ outcome\n\nFor everyone else? Bootstrapping is often a better path.\n\nThe bootstrapped founders I’ve helped:\n\n* Answer to customers, not a board\n* Grow at a healthy pace\n* Take profit whenever they want\n* Actually sleep at night\n\nMost businesses need money — but not necessarily **venture** money.\n\nI’ve seen too many founders chase an exit that never comes, giving away more and more ownership along the way.

        "selftext": "\nHi team,\n\nI’ve been working on my startup as a side hustle alongside my university educated day job for 10 years now. The R&D has certainly come a long way bootstrapping the whole time. I’ve been scared to take any investment because I knew that I could bootstrap that little bit longer and as a result give away less equity the further along I got it. But it’s come at a cost I didn’t think about 10 years ago, I’ve swapped gained equity for life time. \n\nI feel so behind compared to my friends and family members of similar age who are all marked with children. I had a relationship for 8 years of the startup’s life and 2 years ago it all got too much and we separated. She wanted to move forward and I just couldn’t commit to having kids before the R&D was earning revenue. When I first started the startup at 24 I thought ‘I’ll be a millionaire in a few years’. It’s not about the money specifically, it’s about the financial security of being able to do something I love rather than the day job that I don’t love. But here we are now I’m 36 and single and I feel ashamed going on dates and admitting that I don’t have a house or a nice car (which would normally be associated with my day job). I’ve attached the idea of success in the startup to my def worth as a person. Deep down I think I’ve had the belief that I need the startup to succeed in order to be loveable - even to those that admit they love me because I was/am under the illusion I need to be successful before anyone could see me and was/am too ashamed at my position relative to where I thought I would be. \n\nI should add: the startup is in the biology and material science field. It takes a long time to grow things but the IP developed along the way compounds, it’s a little different to a software startup. \n\nTL;DR: The R&D is certainly close to investment level and I can’t stop, I just feel behind, embarrassed and ashamed at where I am compared to where I thought I would be at this point in life. I’m sure so many of you can relate - I’d love to hear your experiences to just help me realise I’m not a loser or alone and that it’s all going to be ok. For anyone else who needs to hear this: you’re not alone, I’m right hear with you and I hope it’ll all work out for us. \n\nMy takeaway/what I've learnt: James Dyson has been a major role model for me. I've always wanted to operate like him and be successful without external funding but we're not all James Dyson and have a product as revolutionary as that. I am learning to accept that 100% of 0 is still 0. It's better to own part of a million/billion dollar company than to own all of a worthless company. Time to ask for help.",

I never thought it was possible for me to start like that. I mean I was working in a company a year ago and now I’m doing my own thing. It’s exciting and I have already learned so much. \n\nWishing you all the best for your journey being or becoming a freelancer. \n",
