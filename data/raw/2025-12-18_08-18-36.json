We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward. I’d really appreciate any advice :)",

        "selftext": "Used to say yes to every \"quick coffee\" or \"pick your brain\" request. Felt good. I was helpful. Building karma. Being a good guy. After 500+ free consultations over 5 years, I realized something uncomfortable:\n\n90% never implemented anything. 5% implemented poorly then blamed my advice when it didn't work. 5% succeeded but never mentioned where they got the idea. The math: roughly 500 hours × €100/hour opportunity cost = €50,000 in free consulting.\n\nReturn on investment: 0 referrals, 0 clients, 0 equity, 0 thank-yous.\n\nSo I changed approach: \"Happy to help. My consulting rate is €150/hour. First 15 minutes free to see if I can actually add value.\"\n\nWhat happened surprised me: The time-wasters disappeared immediately. The serious people paid gladly and showed up prepared. The advice I gave was sharper because I had skin in the game. Implementation rate went from \\~10% to 80%+ because paying creates commitment.\n\nUncomfortable truth I learned: Free advice often helps your ego more than the recipient. When people have even €50 invested, they actually listen and execute instead of just collecting opinions. But suggesting this feels \"greedy\" so most of us keep bleeding time into conversations that go nowhere.\n\nFor those running service businesses: how do you handle the constant \"can I pick your brain\" requests without either burning out or feeling like an asshole?",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
