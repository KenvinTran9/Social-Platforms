        "selftext": "I run a small business in Australia. Stripe is keeping $7,946 of my money permanently. When I posted about it on r/stripe, it hit 16,000 views within hours. Then the mods removed it. Screenshots attached.\n\nThis is what happened.\n\nA client paid me $5,500 USD for completed AI development work. Stripe refuses to release it. Their justification: a completely unrelated $50 dispute from a random person. That dispute is already resolved. The person got their refund weeks ago. Case closed.\n\nDespite that, Stripe is using this resolved $50 dispute to hold nearly $8,000 that has nothing to do with it.\n\nKey facts:\n\n• I passed all verification requirements. Identity, documents, compliance checks. Dashboard showed all tasks completed.\n\n• Stripe froze my account the day before the payout was scheduled. Not during any investigation. They waited until the last moment.\n\n• Stripe claimed they would refund money to customers within five days. My client confirmed they received nothing. Stripe kept the funds.\n\n• My client provided a signed statement confirming the payment was legitimate, the work was delivered, and no dispute will ever be filed. Stripe ignored it.\n\n• All communication from Stripe is a copy-paste response: “high risk.” No explanation, no evidence, no path to resolution.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nDisputed amount: $50\nAmount Stripe is keeping: $7,946\nRatio: 160 times the disputed amount\nThe dispute is from a different customer and is already resolved.\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n\n• Complaint filed with Stripe. Their final answer: “We’re keeping your money.”\n• Complaint filed with AFCA (Australian Financial Complaints Authority). Case number: 12-25-334332\n• Final Notice filed in SA Magistrates Court. Case number: FNL-25-010285\n• Report filed with ACCC for unconscionable conduct. Reference: accc-report:0098524\n• Posted on r/stripe. Removed after going semi-viral. Screenshots attached.\n\nI followed every rule. Verified identity. Provided documentation. Delivered the work. My client is happy. Stripe decided to keep the money anyway.\n\nIf Stripe can withhold funds arbitrarily, ignore evidence, and silence criticism, every small business is at risk.\n\nSharing this so others understand the danger before relying on Stripe.",

Meanwhile my beautifully designed kanban boards that I spent forever perfecting? Crickets.\n\nNow im sitting here wondering if I should just pivot completely and go all in on invoicing/billing tools or keep pretending my PM features matter.

But then I thought about it and honestly the extra income would be great especially since I've been trying to save up for better equipment. The margins on wholesale arent amazing but its consistent money and I can probably negotiate better terms since she clearly needs my product.\n\nWe met for coffee and shes actually super cool.
