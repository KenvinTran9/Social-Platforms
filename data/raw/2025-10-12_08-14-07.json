I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads. I came up with a brand true to me, an awkward autistic woman.\n\nAnd it worked. Owners who told me no before are now telling me yes. \n\nIt is all thanks to the only people that told me my llc was shit. \n\nLove you, r/smallbusiness",

I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me.

It‚Äôs AI powered Reddit marketing platform that generates human like posts and comments for your product. While it might not sound like much to some, for me it's absolutely mind-blowing.\n\nWhat makes this even more special is that I've been using my own tool to grow it. There's something powerful about being your own customer. Every time I use the platform to promote organically on Reddit, I discover new ways to make it better. It's like having a built-in feedback loop that keeps pushing the product forward.\n\nLet me share where we stand right now:\n\n44 people have signed up so far\n\n13 amazing customers who believe in what we're building\n\n$250 in mrr\n\n1774 visitors to our website\n\nLooking back at my launch day notes, these numbers felt impossibly far away. But here I am, and I'm incredibly grateful for every single person who's joined us on this journey.\n\nLooking ahead, I'm already planning the next phase. I'm exploring ways to expand AI capabilities to make the posts and comments even more genuine and engaging. The potential for growth is massive, and I'm setting my sights on reaching $1000 MRR by the end of next month.\n\nOne thing I've learned: when you combine a clear vision with consistent daily improvements, amazing things start happening. The journey from here looks both challenging and thrilling. To everyone else building something meaningful right now: keep pushing forward. The results will come.\n\nI'll make sure to keep this community updated as I continue growing. Your support and feedback have been invaluable so far!",

Growth stoped (I mean that rapidly). 2020 year outside and I decided to do something for myself and launch own side projects. For 4 years I've been trying to build something that ppl will use. Sometimes I did it alone, sometimes with co-founders. In the end - none of my 6+ projects made it any further then 10-20 semi-active users. I know the mistakes I made and this post is not about HOW-TO or HOW-NOT-TO, but rather - what you guys do when your life turns into a complete uncertainty and there is no clear way forward?\n\nI took a month of break of doing absolutely nothing to kinda reset myself. Yet I still think I have to do something in the side-project area (btw, I work 9-5 as well so that's why I call it side- project). But I have more questions then answers.\n\nAll the AI hype is becoming really scary. I see little to no founders who actually raised VC funds but was able to move on significantly (take YC updates - 99% of all their alumnis are not even live after pre-ceed).\n\nOpenAI and others are releasing one feature after another that kills lots of startups that worked on it before. And I mean, yeah, it makes sense. \n\nSo what am I suppose to do? Ignore all the noise and still double down on GPT wrappers and do as everyone does - apply to YC and hope my stuff will actually work? Or shall I double down on my corporate work, admit I'm a bad founder and move on with 9-5? I'm 36yo and apparently time is of the essence. Or, maybe kill that founder mood and search for co-founders and just be a founding engineer?\n\nWould really love to hear from ppl in similar boat (if there are such). Cheers!",
