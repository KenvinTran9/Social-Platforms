She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I just wanted to hear anecdotal stories of similar experiences. How did it work out for you if this happened to you or someone you knew? Just talking about it when I can’t talk to anyone in real life about this will make me feel better.\n\nBefore I bought the restaurant, I hired an accountant to assist me with the due diligence. The seller gave us tax returns, profit and loss statements from their accountant, etc. I bought the assets of the company and started a new LLC, got a new EIN, etc to run it.\n\nThe restaurant is close to failing. I am months away from declaring bankruptcy and walking away. But only a few months ago I learned that the seller gave me fake numbers during due diligence. \n\nI don’t want to share too much but my lawyer thinks we have a pretty clear case of fraud, modifying documents to obtain money under false pretenses, and good, admissible evidence to prove it.\n\nI just know the legal process will take forever. I know the person I’m suing can leave the country and hide forever. I know what all the possible outcomes are, but I want to hear stories of what people have seen in real life good or bad.\n\nI found a case very similar to mine and it gives me hope:\n\nhttps://bc-llp.com/2930000-jury-verdict-on-intentional-misrepresentation-reported-by-verdicts-settlements/\n\nI found another case that is similar that it’s seller’s fraud in a business transaction but I don’t know the outcome of the trial or if damages were awarded to the plaintiffs:\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/2012/a3112-10.html\n\nThe person I am suing still has the money I paid them for this transaction. I just want that back plus attorneys fees plus my losses from operating this restaurant.\n\nIf they are found guilty of fraud then at least I know they can’t discharge this judgment in bankruptcy.",

        "selftext": "Hey y'all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I launched a SaaS company 2 years ago and it's been doing pretty well. It's a web accessibility widget that business owners can pay $50/month for (or $499 a year) to stay ADA compliant. After trying dozens of other businesses since 2019 (Shopify, Amazon FBA, SMMA, etc.), this is the only thing I've found success with :')\n\nAnd this afternoon, I crossed $1 million+ in lifetime revenue (\\~85% margins) and I couldn't be more thrilled! Unfortunately, I don't have anyone super close to me that I can share this with, as my father passed in January. So I figured I'd share it with a bunch of internet strangers.\n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "I'm a freelance video editor and I’ve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up — and I’m not sure how to break the cycle.\n\nThis is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything.",
