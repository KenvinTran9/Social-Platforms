Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer - Post only for those with 0 MRR, No startup, wanna be founder/solopreneur/Indie hacker etc \n\nDisclaimer continued - \n\nBefore coming to main thing, why you should trust me?\n\nI am not going to share any links, screenshots, stripe dashboards but I will say you must have did 100 things till today, why not trust me for few seconds and try 101th too. \n\nIf this doesnt makes sense or don't work out, come after trying abuse me. I will accept that gracefully.   \n  \n**How to get sales when trying startup for the first time ?**\n\n**Step 1.** Define who you are, your strengths, your network, like write down everything about you. \n\nConfused? I will go with example - \n\nYesterday I launched my playbook for wanna be founders, but why? I got this idea because - \n\n\\- I myself founded startup and made it good recurring income  \n\\- I got 5K followers on Linkedin - students of my college, my ex team mates, people in indie hacking etc  \n\\- I got 600+ followers on X - same ICP  \n\\- I spend my time making friends on discord, reddit, X and linkedin who are interested in startups and have no money and idea but lot of ambition.\n\nSo if you see that my daily life told me WHOM i connect with, WHO are my connections, WHAT life i myself have lived. So ask yourself about experiences, connections, strengths etc and thats how you will your NICHE, SECTOR, ICP, etc etc \n\nStay with me. \n\n**Step 2.** Now after knowing your accessibilities, we need IDEA, like what to build, what to sell - \n\nDo not start creating new category, do not start becoming Elon Musk on day 1. \n\nMost easiest and fastest way is to see VALIDATED & SUCCESSFUL ideas doing decent or good in your niche and which aligns with your things you figured out in step 1. \n\nAgain confused? My example - \n\nI saw all indie hackers launching playbooks after first successful $10K MRR product, I did same. I made my own. \n\nI saw about how they sell, how they price, I saw playbooks sell via word of mouth more than marketing, I saw how to share your tricks and learnings everything. So its a validated thing.\n\nBetter example - My first indie tool was a service, not even product back then - just a directory submission service \\[ copied from listingbott of john rush \\] \n\nI saw his idea.  \n\\- people were using it  \n\\- John was bragging \n\nNow I found some pseudo users - WHO WANT TO BUY ABC TOOL BUT THEY HAVE SOME ISSUES - just solve these issues and these are your early 10 customers.\n\nListingbott had issues like - High price, no customer support, no clarity, bad reports etc. I CLEARED THEM ALL and texted 4 bad review people and told them I will do it at 1/5th price. \n\nI got my first customer. \n\n**Step 3.** Market before you build \n\n\\[ It's not valid for all cases but general thing \\] \n\nI did my first sale without even domain name, second sale and third sale too without anything. YES my X account helped maybe you can;t do it but that's why I told you in step 1, find your strengths so that next moves and uncertainities align with your power punches. \n\nI built landing page using lovable, and added paypal \\[ dodo payments wasnt launched back then \\] and started making list of all my competitors, their bad reviewers and also people calling them out. Took 3 days, reached to all of them, shared why I made it, and told them I can solve their issues at less price and better service.\n\nI got lucky \\[ see 70% luck is there, honestly. BUT if luck wasn;t there I would still have made it as I keep trying \\]  \n\nGot my first 10 customers, and 3 public posted reviews. \n\nThat's the beginning.\n\n**Step 4.** Time to build product \n\nObviously won't share details of getmorebacklinks as that trade secret but we took around 40 days to build it. \n\nAfter your first 10 customers, you should continue marketing, share updates, post daily and start building your final product. \n\n\\- Always take reviews from people on X and reddit, there are hundreds of people their like me dropping suggestions here and there, but I mean it - those reviews are valuable, those helped me and will help you too. \n\n**Step 5.** Launch, foundation and road to first 100 paying customers\n\nNow   \n\\- you have maybe 10-20 customers who paid.  \n\\- a ready product   \n\n\n\\- Start posting in communities where your potential customers are found online.  \n\\- Start posting on X, reddit, linkedin, engage on discord, facebook groups etc  \n\\- Launch your product on producthunt, thousands of directories, Hacker News etc  \n\\- Build in public - share success, failures, updates, features, do collabs and compete too\n\nStart foundational work which will help you after 100 days - SEO   \n\\- Build backlinks  \n\\- Upload blogs  \n\\- Make free tools relevant to your ICP  \n\\- Make pSEO pages  \n\\- Boost your DR   \n\\- Launch on multiple platforms etc \n\nAlways keep listening to your customers, add updates, add features and keep sharing & marketing. \n\nFind WHY?  \nWhy are people buying  \nwhy are people not buying  \nwhy are people buying yours, not others  \nwhy are people buying your competitors tools, not yours  \nwhy can't people find you  \nhow did they find you  \netc\n\nFind answer to every why and keep making those better.\n\nLike when I launched my playbook yesterday, I did 9 pages extra update because of so many inputs from a single reddit post. That's how you listen, research and act fast. \n\n**Step 6.** KEEP DOING IT FOR 1000 times\n\nJust keep doing above things until you get 100 customers, in all cases if you daily find \"WHY?\" you will end up with 100 customers, maybe your product will be changed 100% but still your purpose was 100 customers. \n\n**Step 7.** Road to 1000 customers \n\n\\- Time to build your customer groups  \n\\- Start seasonal offers  \n\\- Make yearly plans for more runway  \n\\- Boost your SEO efforts  \n\\- Triple down on your sales channels, double down on your potential sales channels  \n\n\nWhen I saw X is giving me highest revenue per visitor for getmorebacklinks, I started engaging more, gave offers to post reviews, I made friends, took part in online campaigns. That's how you double down your primary sales channel. At same time I saw reddit and Linkedin - I never stopped marketing there. I kept on doing it. \n\nFrom yearly sales, start investing in A/B testing of Ads, yearly sales give runway of upto 10 months and this money should be used to scale. \n\nand that's how I did $10K, that's the easy, fast and tested way to do it. \n\nI hope all of this helped you. Keep me updated if it helped you, if you want to challenge me on any part, please do it, we will have healthy discussion. \n\nSorry for any grammar mistakes, After writing for 20-25 minutes, I saw that it got very long and I did fast check only.
