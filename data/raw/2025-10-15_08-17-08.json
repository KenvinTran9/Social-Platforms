Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we’d been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn’t realize they were using the same thing. We’re not “corporate” enough to hire a CFO, but I’m spending way too much time trying to figure out where money’s going. I’ve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging?

I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct.

Last month we actually missed paying rent on our office space because we couldn’t agree who should transfer the payment.
