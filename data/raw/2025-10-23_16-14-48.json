I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "inb4; sorry for polishing with AI - my English is not the best tbh that was the only way to share the story.\n\nI'm 27 now.  \nWhen I was 26, I started a small restaurant business with a friend. We built it from scratch concept, branding, design, suppliers, operations I was handling everything day to day.\n\nThe place was actually a¬†huge success traffic-wise, but the financial calculations my business partner made were way off ‚Äî our prices were too low, and we were too busy to notice. I trusted his numbers because he already owned another food place, and I assumed he knew what he was doing.\n\nThen a new investor came in. He seemed smart, calm, and experienced ‚Äî about twenty years older than me. After he sent the first part of the money he promised, we finally sat down together to go through the numbers. That‚Äôs when we both realized how bad things really were.\n\nMy first partner told me,¬†*‚ÄúIf we ever leave this business, we leave it together.‚Äù*  \nThat didn‚Äôt happen. He stayed.\n\nThe new investor set¬†completely unrealistic conditions¬†- he wanted me to pay him back¬†**around $25,000 within a year**, which was impossible. On top of that, he tried to trick me into working under him, basically making me his employee in the same business I had built. Staying in that deal would‚Äôve forced me to abandon my first company ‚Äî the one I‚Äôd been building for years ‚Äî just to pay off someone else‚Äôs mistake.\n\nHe kept the brand, both locations, and gave me zero chance to get my money back ‚Äî not even for the equipment and stuff I had personally bought to make the place work. I got completely burned out, financially and mentally destroyed.\n\nI lost around¬†**$20,000‚Äì$22,500**¬†personally.  \nI went through months of therapy and sessions with a psychiatrist because I simply couldn‚Äôt cope with it. I‚Äôm currently on raising doses of Brintellix and trying to get my shit back together ‚Äî which is not easy. Oh man, it‚Äôs not.\n\nAlmost all of my debts are paid off now, but this thing burned the hell out of me.  \nI still have another business that I‚Äôve been running for six years, but it‚Äôs only bringing around¬†**$5,500/month**, which in my country isn‚Äôt much.\n\nI used to have some safe investments ‚Äî ETFs, bonds, even gold but I really wanted to finally make a proper living doing something bigger. Instead, I got lied to, manipulated, and scammed.\n\nEvery day feels like a fight with myself. I know logically I‚Äôm out of the worst part, but emotionally, it feels like I‚Äôve lost everything.\n\nEdit. I wanted to go legal, but after some thinly veiled threats in person, I didn‚Äôt feel safe to pursue it then.\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar?  \nHow did you rebuild your self-trust and your wallet?  \nDid you manage to truly recover from something like this?",
