Since day one, I've been giving a free burger to a homeless guy who comes in 3 times a week. I've always been happy to help him out, but last week, things took a turn.\n\nHe came in on a Saturday, and I had to tell him I couldn't give him a free burger because I was running low on product. I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

Also, I received a call from a huge company (Indian customer service I think that tells you all you need to know ;) ) about buying my app for $1.5 billion and a contract that includes free use of the company’s private jet, private island, mansion and more.\n\nI instantly accepted their offer, gave the my mom’s credit card number and internet banking password and am currently waiting for the money to come in. To say it's a it career speedrun is an understatement :) my relatives don't know (my mom has no idea lol), real-life gf non existent. Only my imaginary furry girlfriend knows because I tell her everything (she makes me, otherwise I get punished).\n\nThere is no point in advertising anything anymore, so I will answer your questions as best as I can while waiting for my money to come in. \n\nThe most important thing to know is that luck is, of course, very important, but the most important thing is your ideas.\n\n>I will be answering your questions but I’m closing the AMA because my mom says she wants to have a talk (she must be so proud and happy!!)",

Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we’d been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn’t realize they were using the same thing. We’re not “corporate” enough to hire a CFO, but I’m spending way too much time trying to figure out where money’s going. I’ve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging?

Half the receipts get lost, nobody remembers what category things belong to, and by the time I match everything, the month’s already over.
