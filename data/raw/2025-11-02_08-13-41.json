        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "We opened up a music store a few miles from another music store that is focused on different things (we focus on school band instrument repair and rentals, other shop mostly does used gear and sells records) we are about as different as an automotive body shop is to an automotive mechanical repair shop. \n\nI have had only one interaction with the other store - he kicked me out and cursed at me when I went to deliver a package that was mistakenly delivered to us when we first opened. Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",
