        "selftext": "Pretty random but thought I’d share (just read the book about Amazon). Bezos made a TON of money as an angel investor into Google.\n\nTLDR: In 1998, Amazon acquired a startup called Junglee and the acquisition was basically a disaster. But one of the employees, Ram Shriram, ended up intro’ing Bezos to Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They show him a prototype, and he wrote a $250k check on the spot into their $1M seed round.\n\nFast forward to Google’s IPO in 2004, that $250k was worth $280M. If he had held on to it, that would have been $20B today (I heard that on the Acquired podcast).\n\nPretty much the reality of investing in startups. If you're already meeting smart people and building relationships, the opportunities show up in your workflow. Not from \"deal hunting.\"",

        "selftext": "Got a call yesterday from someone in my network. Fintech founder, zero technical background. Says she got hacked. As she tells me the story, I can't believe the chain of events.\n\nStarted like many do now: lovable, v0, cursor. Generating screens, connecting APIs. Great for validation at first. Problem is, she kept going. MONTHS wrestling with prompts until she had a monster with:\n\n* Credit scoring\n* AI agents\n* Dashboards\n* Reports\n* And many more\n\nAll prompt-generated. Zero understanding of the code. Shows it to a BANK. They like it. Tell her to move forward (she had a great business network btw). No idea what to do. Hires a team to \"refactor\". Quote: 300+ hours. Basically the cost of building a proper MVP from scratch.\n\nBut wait, it gets better.\n\nThe team she hired ALSO does vibe coding. They set up the server by asking ChatGPT. Result:\n\n* SSH open to the world\n* Root password: admin123 (or something similar)\n* No firewall\n* Nothing\n\nAutomated ransomware encrypted everything. Had to shut down, rotate all API keys (costing $$$), migrate everything.\n\nThe founder lost money on the hack, so much time, credibility with the client and trust in the process.\n\nHere's the thing: Would you send a contract to a client without reading it, just because AI wrote it? Would you send an investor pitch without knowing what it says? Of course not. So why would you run your entire technical infrastructure on code you can't read?\n\nAI amplifies what you already know. If you understand business, AI makes you better at business. If you know code, AI makes you code 10x faster. But if you know nothing about code and try to build a tech product with just prompts, you're not in control of your own company.\n\nThe new reality post-AI: You don't need 10 developers anymore. You need 1-3 people who REALLY know their domain, amplified by AI. That's more powerful than 20 people without AI.\n\nThat's what vibe coding in production is: unsupervised juniors all the way down.",

        "selftext": "# \"Comfort is the worst addiction\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nI think some of you might relate to this, some of you might learn from my mistakes.\n\nSince I was 15-16 years old I did every business model you can think of: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, Amazon FBA, Amazon Merch, Amazon KDP... you name it. I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in. Enough comfort to survive, not enough pain to change, slowly dying inside while calling it \"rest\", \"balance\" or \"taking time\".  \nComfort isn't rest, it is a cage with pillows.\n\nSo if you're building your business now, procrastinating your next project or thinking about quitting. **LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT**. That is where all the progress lives.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life learning this the hard way. I just hope that even one person who reads this, avoids the same trap that got me.",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me.

        "selftext": "I have recently started my own small business. I thought it would make me financially independent as I cannot work in a normal job like evryone else because of my Bipolar Disorder. But the moment I started my business I started facing so many issues. First issue was trusting vendors you meet online. I foolishly got scammed by fake vendors who sent me realistic invoices but the products never arrived. This drained my savings and made my family lose trust on me.  So instead of taking a big loan and a big risk I decided to start a small business with small loan without knowing that there will be a lot of gatekeepers and hidden costs and without working capital. I finally found an Honest vendor who provided me with my goods but my definition of good quality and his definition were different due social status. I wanted to sell to middle and upper middle class people. He thought the same quality applies for all. And in India there is so much paper work, so I got scammed by those who do the paper work. Got scammed by those who made labels because they over priced. I am the first one in generations of my family and caste to ever start a business so we had no inside knowledge and my own friends who come from business castes acted as gate keepers because that's what they are taught. I tried to find distributors for my product but most of them first take the product and then pay if they are sold. So I would have to blindly trust them because even if they cheat despite proper documentation no legal authorities will care or interfere and they know that.  So now I have a lot of product and no way to sell. Social media marketing attracted a few friends and supporters to buy but then the Postal department refused to send my product as it's food, so I had to rely on private courier which cut all my margins. Nobody reveals where to buy cheap packaging. Nobody reveals how to deliver your packages at cheap prices. No body reveals how to get to honest distributors. In India , I think the society is designed to keep new entrants into any business and keep the businesses only to certain communities and keep the rest of the societies as slaves to corporates so they keep buying from only these communities when it comes to small scale businesses..",
