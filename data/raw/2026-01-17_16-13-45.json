        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "title": "Quitting My $200k Engineering Job to Start a SaaS: What Nobody Will Ever Tell You",
        "selftext": "Two years ago I walked away from a $200k base salary. I wanted to focus on building something on my own and leveraging my skills. On paper everything seemed flawless. In reality this was the hardest decision I have ever made.\n\nMost people talk about going all in like it is a movie montage. It is not. It is a messy, isolating grind that breaks most people.\n\nThe Structure Shock When you are a Staff Engineer you have built in momentum. You have stand ups, tickets, and peers who validate your existence. When you go solo that scoreboard vanishes. I spent the first three months working 14 hour days and feeling like I had accomplished zero. There is no done state anymore. There is just an endless void of tasks where coding is actually the easiest part of the day.\n\nThe Work Multiplies and the Clock is Ticking People think quitting means you finally get time to build. It does. But now you are the entire company and you are bleeding cash. Every single department shows up at your door every morning and the financial weight is heavy. You are responsible for:\n\n* Product Improvement: This is critical. You are constantly obsessing over the roadmap and refining the vision to ensure the core value actually exists.\n* Financial Pressure: You are paying thousands in infrastructure and operations. You are spending thousands more on ads to get eyes on the product. The clock is ticking and it is ticking fast.\n* QA and Support: You are the one answering every customer question and ensuring the product actually works when people log in.\n* Marketing and Sales: Trying to get anyone to care while running demos for people who might never buy.\n* Onboarding and Retention: Making sure users stay after they sign up and figuring out why they churn.\n\nThe Skills Gap is a Wall I am technical enough to have won multiple hackathons running on a few hours of sleep including OpenAI and Horizon AI. That is just the easier part of the game. Scaling a SaaS is the real sauce. Distribution is the game and the product is just your entry ticket. That is a hard truth for an engineer to swallow. Marketing is a specific type of pain because it is so broad. You have to learn SEO, paid ads, funnels, and copy that does not sound like a robot.\n\nThe Momentum Mismatch In engineering effort usually equals output. In a startup you can push a boulder uphill for a month, lose your grip, and end up further back than where you started. That mismatch is brutal. I have spent countless nights staring at a screen until 2:00 AM brainstorming improvements and wondering why the momentum is not matching my expectations. You put in the work but the needle just does not move.\n\nThe Loneliness is Underrated My friends think I am living the dream because I work from home. They see the sweatpants and assume the lifestyle is chill. It is not chill. There is no teammate to share the burden or say we are fine. Nobody else fully understands the specific problem you are trying to solve. You move from confidence to anxiety and from hope to frustration daily. It is not just building a product. It is managing your own psychology.\n\nWhere it stands now The SaaS is growing and making thousands in MRR but I am always with the constant thought that it is not growing fast enough. I have stopped romanticizing motivation and started treating this like a long war. I ship, I measure, I talk to users, and I repeat. Some weeks nothing works. Then one small thing clicks and you remember why you started.\n\nI have learned more in these 24 months than in a decade of traditional jobs because the market does not care about your feelings. It only cares if you solve a problem.\n\n# Question for the community\n\nFor those who quit a high-paying job to build SaaS:\n\nWhat was the hardest part for you?  \nAnd what do you wish you knew before you made the jump?",

        "selftext": "* 80%+ of people prefer Google sign in\n* Removing all branding/formatting from emails and sending them from a real name increases open rate\n* You won’t know when you have PMF but a good sign is that people buy and tell their friends about your product\n* 99.9% of people that approach you with some offer are a waste of time\n* Sponsoring creators is cheaper but takes more time than paid ads\n* Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want\n* Once you become successful there will be lots of copy cats but they only achieve a fraction of what you do. You are the source to their success\n* I would never be able to build a good product if I didn’t use it myself\n* Always monitor logs after pushing new updates\n* Bugs are fine as long as you fix them fast\n* People love good design\n* Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far\n* Always refund people that want a refund\n* Asking where people heard about you during onboarding makes marketing 10x easier\n* Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n* Don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more\n* A surprising amount of users are willing to get on a call to talk about your product and it’s super helpful\n* Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product\n* Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success\n* Even when things are going well you’ll have moments when you doubt everything, just have to shut that voice out and keep going\n\nFor context, [my app](https://aicofounder.com/) guides users through researching and planning their product.",

        "selftext": "I just spent my entire Sunday filming Instagram reels and I'm losing my mind.\n\nFreelance brand designer, three years in. Work is fine. But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
