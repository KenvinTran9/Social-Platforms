        "title": "I’ve had 3 exits (2 as a founder). Stop hiring a traditional VP of Marketing. You need a \"Marketing Engineer.\" Here is why.",
        "selftext": "I have been on both sides of the table. I built two companies as a founder, had three exits in total, and now I spend my days building new ventures with entrepreneurs.\n\nThe biggest red flag I see in pitch decks right now is the \"Marketing Strategy\" slide. Most founders are still planning for 2025 (or 2015). They want to hire a creative writer or a brand expert to run ads and do PR.\n\nIf you are building a startup for 2026, you need to stop treating marketing as a creative department and start treating it as an engineering problem.\n\nThe founders winning today aren't asking \"How can AI write this post?\". They are asking \"How can AI build a distribution machine?\".\n\nHere are 10 engineering mechanisms we are implementing to replace the traditional marketing department. These aren't theories, they are systems you can build today.\n\n1. The Infinite Creative Loop Stop paying designers to make one banner. We build agents that generate hundreds of variations of hooks and visuals. The system watches the data. If Variation A works, it breeds variations A1 and A2 automatically. It is evolutionary biology applied to ads.\n\n2. Adaptive Budget Allocation Humans are too slow to manage budgets across 50 campaigns. We let scripts monitor the CPA. If a campaign hits the target, the money moves there instantly. It allows small teams to run high volume experiments without burning cash.\n\n3. Signal Hunting for LTV Don't just stare at Excel. We let LLMs run on raw user data to find weird correlations humans miss. For example, finding that users who saw a specific \"Social Proof\" screen during the quiz converted 3x better to paid plans weeks later.\n\n4. Contextual Data Layer We are moving away from static dashboards like Tableau. The new standard is a data layer that AI agents can query and \"talk\" to directly to get answers.\n\n5. From SEO to AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Search is moving from Google links to ChatGPT answers. The new strategy isn't keywords, it is \"Community Authority.\" We analyze where our audience hangs out (like specific subreddits or forums) and create high-value content hubs that LLMs will cite as sources. We don't spam; we become the reference.\n\n6. Dynamic Real-Time Quizzes Static forms kill conversion. A modern onboarding quiz generates questions dynamically based on the previous answer. If the tech detects urgency, the next question digs into that specific pain point immediately.\n\n7. Behavioral Activation Most churn happens because users don't find value fast enough. Instead of generic email flows, intelligent systems detect \"stuck moments\" in the UI and trigger a specific message or video to unblock that specific user right then and there.\n\n8. Programmatic Personal Video Video converts better than text, but you can't record a thousand videos. We use tools to record once and let the software change the lipsync and audio to say the specific lead's name and company.\n\n9. Competitor Weakness Mining Instead of guessing what to write, we scrape competitors' 1-star reviews. The system clusters the complaints and auto-generates landing pages specifically addressing those pain points.\n\n10. Active Churn Prevention We connect an LLM to the support ticket stream. The system detects \"Anger\" sentiment before a human agent even opens the ticket and drafts a de-escalation response or suggests a compensation offer automatically.\n\nThe Takeaway The advantage in 2026 won't be who has the best slogan. It will be who adopts engineering into their growth stack the fastest.\n\nI shared my stack, but I’m sure I missed some good ones. What \"Marketing Engineering\" hacks or automations have you built that gave you an unfair advantage? Share them below.",

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.
