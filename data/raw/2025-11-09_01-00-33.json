        "selftext": "So here’s what happened.\n\nI sold a handmade sculpture on Amazon, something I put a lot of time and care into. The buyer, a woman named Emily, got it just fine. Then out of nowhere, she messages me saying she wants to return it because it “looks better at a lower level.” Her exact words were basically that the eyes looked off when she put it higher up.\n\nI told her nicely that I can’t take it back for that reason. The piece looks exactly like the photos, and I’m not a big company that can just eat losses because someone didn’t like how it looked on a shelf. I’m one person making and shipping these myself.\n\nShe didn’t like that. She got defensive, saying my question “didn’t make sense” and that the “advertising didn’t match her hopes.” Whatever that means.\n\nThen she started opening return cases. Three of them. Each time she gave a new reason. The last one? She claimed the item was “defective.” Totally false. Nothing wrong with it, she just didn’t like how it looked where she put it.\n\nAnd guess what? Amazon **refunded her in full** without even checking if she returned it. She didn’t. She still has the piece and the money.\n\nSo now I’m out the cost, the time, and the product, all because someone abused the return system and Amazon just automatically sided with her. No evidence, no verification, nothing.\n\nI reported everything to Amazon and posted about it on the forums because this is getting ridiculous. I followed every rule. The listing was accurate. The photos were clear. And yet somehow, a customer can just say “defective” and walk away with both the product and a full refund.\n\nI’m honestly just fed up. This kind of thing might be nothing to a big company, but for a small artist, it hurts.",

        "title": "I paid 5 influencers on LinkedIn to promote my SAAS : here’s what $1250 got me",
        "selftext": "A few weeks ago I decided to test something new for my SaaS.  \nInstead of running more cold email or ads, I tried using LinkedIn influencers.\n\nI wanted to get people to comment on a post, send them a Notion resource, and redirect them to my site.\n\nThe experiment ran for two weeks, and I spent 1,250 dollars in total for five influencers.\n\nYou can check [the influencer's post + profile here](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-influencer-campaign-29bb9abcbe3f80f8aefff2323103f3e4?source=copy_link)\n\n**Step 1: Finding influencers**\n\nThere are basically two types of influencers. The niche experts who have small but super relevant audiences. And the viral creators who get huge reach but with less qualified people.\n\nI picked a mix of both.\n\nI searched for people who had already done sponsored posts for competitors. I DMed more than fifty of them, compared pricing and engagement stats, and selected five.  \nI wrote the posts myself and made the visuals so everything looked consistent.\n\n**Step 2: The process**\n\nEach influencer posted exactly what I gave them.  \nWhen people commented, they replied with a Notion link. The more comments, the more reach, the more clicks.\n\nInside that Notion page, I included a link to my SaaS trial and a “book a demo” button.  \nEach influencer had a personalized page with a tracking link.  \nOne of them even customized the page for their French audience and it performed better than the generic version.\n\nI made sure the Notion resource gave a lot of real value so people thought, “If this is free, the paid version must be crazy.”\n\n**Step 3: The results**\n\nI spent 1,250 dollars. Two influencers brought absolutely nothing. Not even a single visit. Probably engagement pods.\n\n$500 wasted.\n\nThe other three actually worked.\n\nThe first one brought around 75 new signups, 25 trials, 12 paid conversions, and seven demo calls with large teams.  \nThe second one brought 27 signups, nine trials, four paid conversions, and one demo call.  \nThe third one brought 12 signups, five trials, and three paid conversions.\n\nIn total that’s 19 paying customers at 99 dollars per month.  \nThat’s 1,900 dollars in recurring revenue for 1,250 spent.  \nNot bad at all, and definitely something I’ll keep doing.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n\\- Negotiate hard. Prices can easily drop by two or three times if you push a bit.  \n\\- Avoid fake influencers. Many are just engagement groups.  \n\\- Make sure they reply to every comment with your link. If not, do it yourself.  \n\\- Always pay after posting, never before.\n\nI also tried boosting the posts with ads, but it didn’t make much difference.\n\nNext step is to find better influencers, scale the system, and maybe try TikTok next.  \nIf anyone’s interested, I can share the Notion template and DM scripts I used.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask !\n\nHere [are all the proofs](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-influencer-campaign-29bb9abcbe3f80f8aefff2323103f3e4?source=copy_link) (influencer urls + posts)",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

I told him that i can give him a report and I'll submit the report with all the weeks progress but he is arrogant.\n\nI'm not liking the fact that he is treating me like a scammer but in reality I've helped him and I've got solid results. Ive almost completed 99% of work and it's all positive.\n\nI don't know how to deal with him!",
