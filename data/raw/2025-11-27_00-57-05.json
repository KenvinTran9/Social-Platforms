        "selftext": "I’m a solo design professional and I need a sanity check. I’ve never had a client behave like this and I don’t have a mentor to run this by.\n\n**The Context:**\n\n* I have a client who started construction **before** the building permit was issued. He is currently panicked because he’s risking a Stop Work Order or worse.\n* The City review process has been frustrating. The reviewer used generic \"boilerplate\" comments and didn't mark up/redline the reports, just the plans. This ambiguity caused a 3rd review cycle.\n* The City charged a re-submittal fee. It is **$150**.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\n* The Client is demanding I pay this $150 fee out of my own pocket.\n* My contract (and industry standard) states that all agency/permit fees are the Owner's responsibility.\n* I am currently fighting the City to waive the fee on his behalf because I agree the review was lazy, but I told the Client I will not pay it personally if the waiver is denied.\n\n**The Behavior:**\n\n* He is texting me \"???\" late at night.\n* He told me \"I’m a businessman, I know how this works,\" and accused me of \"not taking ownership\" because I won't pay the $150.\n* **He has threatened to sue me.**\n\n**My Position:** I feel like he is projecting his anxiety about his illegal construction onto me. He wants me to pay the fee to validate his narrative that the delays are my fault, not the City's or his own. I’m holding the line on the $150 not because of the money, but because paying it feels like an admission of guilt/liability.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a client like this? Am I wrong for refusing to pay a small fee just to make him shut up, given that he’s already threatened legal action?\n\n**TL;DR:** Client building illegally is trying to bully me into paying a $150 City fee and threatening to sue. I'm standing my ground.",

I checked the founders X profile and saw he has reached $15K MRR and is targeting $1M. My SaaS hardly pulls in $200 MRR. \n\nThis makes me feel like a complete failure, I am in my mid 40s and the other founder is probably decades younger to me.

I was actually pretty good at it too. Booked them 20-30 calls every month.\n\nBut they ran out of money and couldn't keep me on. So that's that.\n\nAlso broke up with my girlfriend during all this. So now I'm single, broke, sitting on all these skills I don't really know what to do with.\n\nMy old construction job would probably take me back. Good money, stable work. But honestly the thought of going back feels like I failed. Like I wasted all this time learning stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone says \"just freelance\" or \"offer your services\" but like... I have no clients, no real portfolio, no clue where to start.\n\nBeen thinking about doing free work or super cheap work just to get case studies and actually talk to people. But idk if that's the move or if it just makes me look desperate.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can build websites fast now, set up email campaigns that work, automate outreach - all this stuff that should be useful. But none of it matters if I don't have anyone to actually do it for.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this? Like a career change that just feels completely stuck?

Buyers knew exactly what they wanted, but it was often hard to find these technical books at local bookstores. Amazon delivered them to you. These technical books were their beachhead.\n\nThis allowed them to prove themselves and they quickly expanded to other books, then DVDs then home goods. Now Amazon is the everything store.\n\nIf you are just starting or trying to grow your business think carefully about your market entry strategy. You can't sell to everyone at first.
