        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "i finally hit 10k mrr with one of my apps\n\nit only took 4 failed launches, dozens of dead end marketing experiments, and more late nights than i'd like to admit\n\nhere's what actually worked:\n\n* communities brought my first 200 users i joined niche facebook groups, answered questions, and dropped the app naturally into conversations direct promo posts got blocked by admins but comments worked well\n* lifetime deals gave me rankings offered early users a one time cheap plan spiked downloads, boosted aso, app now sits top 5 in its category that ranking alone pulls \\~200 new users per week without ads\n* tiktok slideshows brought scale i tested short form videos, memes, talking head clips, nothing really clicked then i switched to slideshow content across 9 themed accounts 3 iphones running full time (3 tiktok accounts per phone) ‚Üí average 40k views a day per account ‚Üí consistent signups initially i made the content manually, but that got unscalable fast so i looked into tools and ended up using reelmoney to automate most of the workflow, much cheaper than others i tried (faceless ninja, reel farm etc) and it just worked better for me, you must try all yourself to get your best\n* niche podcasts drove backlinks did 4 podcasts, each one brought a small bump in traffic but more importantly helped seo compounding over time\n\nwhat didn't work:\n\n* ugc content burned $7.5k, only one video passed 100k views, conversions were poor\n* facebook ads burned $5k, best roas was 1.2, not worth scaling\n* affiliate outreach to \\~50 youtubers, <10% replied, conversions close to zero\n\nthe lesson -> keep stacking experiments and scale your social media accounts\n\nmost won't work, but the few that do can carry everything\n\nthe more you post the more chances of one of your posts getting viral and even if no viral content you consistently keep getting views",
