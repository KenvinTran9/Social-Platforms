        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

I never truly validated the idea with real people. I built something based on my assumptions instead of actual customer needs.\n\nNow running a second business that's profitable, I approach everything differently.\n\nHere are the key changes that saved me:\n\n* Interview at least 30 to 50 potential customers before any serious development.\n* Launch a bare bones MVP as quickly as possible to test demand.\n* Prioritize sales and customer feedback from week one, not perfection.\n\nIf you're just starting or in the early stages, please don't repeat my mistake.

No co-founder, no agency, no bootcamp. Just me, Claude, Cursor, and a mass of copy-pasted Stack Overflow answers that somehow compiles.\n\nPeople call it \"vibe coding.\" I call it \"I don't understand half of my own codebase but the tests pass.\" The product is [Plottie](https://ai.plottie.art) — an AI tool that creates publication-ready scientific figures. Researchers describe what they want, the AI generates it, and they can edit everything on an infinite canvas. Think Canva meets ChatGPT, but for scientific papers.\n\nHere's everything I learned. No fluff, just what actually happened.\n\n## The Pixabay-to-Canva playbook (this was my best decision)\n\nBefore building the AI tool, I built a free discovery platform: [plottie.art](https://plottie.art). It's a searchable database of 100,000+ scientific figures scraped from open-access papers in Nature, Science, Cell, etc. Researchers can browse, search, and save figures for inspiration.\n\nWhy build this first? Because I had no idea if the AI product would work, and I needed traffic.\n\nThe discovery site took ~2 months to build. It started ranking on Google within weeks because it's genuinely useful — if you search for \"volcano plot examples\" or \"heatmap scientific figure,\" we show up. It now gets consistent organic traffic. Every page has a subtle nudge: \"Want to create a figure like this? Try Plottie AI →\"\n\nThis is essentially the Pixabay → Canva model:\n- **Pixabay**: Free stock photos, massive SEO traffic\n- **Canva**: The paid product that Pixabay users naturally graduate to\n\nFor us:\n- **plottie.art**: Free figure discovery, SEO traffic\n- **ai.plottie.art**: The AI creator that discovery users convert to\n\nThe discovery site now drives new users to the AI product every single day, and I spend $0 on ads. If I were starting over, I'd build the free SEO content product first every time. It's the most underrated SaaS growth hack — give away something genuinely useful, let Google do the distribution, and make the paid product the natural next step.\n\n## The paid beta: don't test for free, test for money\n\nWhen the AI tool was ready for testing, I didn't do a free beta. I charged half price from day one.\n\nHere's why: Free users will tell you \"this is great!\" and never come back. Paying users — even at $6/month — will tell you exactly what's broken, because they expect it to work. The feedback quality is completely different.\n\nI recruited on Twitter and a few research communities. 97 people joined at 50% off. Some of the best product decisions came from these 97 people:\n\n- They told me the chat-based UI was broken (I was copying ChatGPT's layout — chat on the left, figure on the right). Turns out researchers need to see 8-24 figures side by side, not one at a time. I scrapped it and built an infinite canvas instead.\n- They told me AI output needed to be editable. My V1 was generate → export → done. Researchers hated it. They need to tweak exact colors for journal guidelines, adjust font sizes for figure legends. AI gets you 80%, but the last 20% is what reviewers actually care about.\n- They told me they wanted diagrams, not just data plots. I built for bar charts and heatmaps. They flooded me with requests for flowcharts, pathway diagrams, and scientific illustrations.\n\nEvery one of these would have taken months longer to discover with a free beta. When someone pays, they're invested enough to actually tell you the truth.\n\n## The numbers (raw, unfiltered)\n\n- **Launch date**: January 21, 2026\n- **Users**: ~2,000+ (organic only, $0 paid acquisition)\n- **Paying**: 100+\n- **MRR**: ~$1,000\n- **Infra cost**: $100-500/month (Cloudflare, Fly.io, Supabase, LLM APIs, E2B sandbox)\n- **Time to build**: ~6 months total (2 months discovery site, 4 months AI tool)\n- **My web dev background**: Zero. Literally none.\n\nThe conversion rate from free to paid is high. The problem isn't conversion. The problem is **top-of-funnel**: I need more people to know this exists.\n\n## What I got wrong\n\n**Marketing. All of it.**\n\nI'm a researcher. I know how to write papers, run experiments, and present at conferences. I do not know how to market a product. My \"marketing strategy\" for the first month was posting on Twitter and hoping. Spoiler: hoping is not a strategy.\n\nWhat's working so far:\n- **SEO via the discovery site** — this is 60%+ of our traffic. Researchers Google for figure types and find us.\n- **Word of mouth in labs** — one researcher tries it, tells their labmates. This is slow but the conversion quality is insane. When someone's PI recommends a tool, they don't comparison shop.\n- **Research communities** — posting genuine value (tutorials, figure tips) in places where researchers hang out, then mentioning Plottie when it's relevant.\n\nWhat's not working:\n- Cold outreach. Researchers ignore cold DMs harder than any market I've seen.\n- Paid ads. Tried briefly. CPA was ridiculous for a $12/month product.\n- Product Hunt. We got some traffic but almost zero conversion. The PH audience doesn't overlap with working scientists.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is distribution. The product-market fit signal is strong — people who find us tend to stay and pay. I just can't figure out how to get in front of 10x more researchers without spending money I don't have.\n\n## Vibe coding: honest assessment\n\nSince people will ask — yes, I built this entire thing with AI assistance. Here's the honest version:\n\n**What works**: Claude/Cursor can scaffold a full Next.js app, write Go API endpoints, build Python FastAPI services, and handle 90% of the frontend. For someone who can't code, this is genuinely life-changing. I went from \"I have an idea\" to \"I have a working product\" in months, not years.\n\n**What doesn't work**: Debugging. When something breaks in production at 2am and the error message is about a Supabase cookie authentication race condition, Claude gives you 5 different answers and 3 of them make it worse. I've spent entire weekends debugging issues that a real developer would fix in an hour.\n\n**The real cost**: My codebase is probably 40% great, 40% \"works but I don't know why,\" and 20% \"this will definitely break at scale and I'm choosing not to think about it.\" I have tech debt that I can't even identify because I don't have the knowledge to recognize it.\n\nBut here's the thing: the product is live, people are paying for it, and the figures they're creating are actually going into published papers. Imperfect code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't exist.\n\n## AMA\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n- Building for academic/research markets\n- The discovery-site-to-paid-product pipeline\n- Paid betas vs. free betas\n- Vibe coding a multi-service SaaS (frontend + backend + AI engine)\n- Anything else\n\n**Disclosure: I'm the founder of Plottie.** This is my product. Sharing because I genuinely want to compare notes with other founders, but I'm upfront about it.\n",

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",
