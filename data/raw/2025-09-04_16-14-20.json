        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

Every few days, I added new features: folder creation, saving prompts for reuse, and much more.\n\nAfter gathering tons of feedback, I realized I‚Äôd solved a real problem - one people were willing to pay for.\n\nFinally, I launched the paid version! There are now three tiers: Free, Monthly Subscription, and Lifetime Access.\n\nHere‚Äôs the wild part: just minutes after flipping the switch, someone from the U.S. bought a lifetime subscription. Then, someone from Spain grabbed a monthly plan. And it just kept going!\n\nOne year ago, I had an idea. Today, I have paying customers. The sense of fulfillment is absolutely unreal - it‚Äôs a feeling that words just can‚Äôt capture. üôå\n\nI think that what really sets me apart is how much I care about my clients. I always make them my top priority, and I try to respond to emails within minutes whenever possible. Providing fast, thoughtful, and reliable support is super important to me because I want my clients to feel valued and taken care of.\n\nIf you are a heavy ChatGPT user, please give it a shot, there is absolutely no way you will regret it.\n\nThis may not exactly be a passive income, but my goal is to get to a larger number of subscribers, and I am working very hard to get there, after that, i hope it will become passive :)",

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "**Hello Startup Reddit. I'm pretty active in this sub when I have time. My favorite topics generally revolve around equity structures, investing, SAFEs, Convertible Notes, Options, term sheets, 409a, 83b, QSBS, tax implications and all things governance, structure, equity, funding, etc.**\n\nThere are others that are better suited to address GTM, Marketing, Sales, Product. I have my opinions but those areas aren't my passion (or probably the best use of my expertise).\n\nIf you look at my comment history, you'll see I'm not afraid to call bullshit and I am pretty direct with my opinions.\n\n**I can't post my LinkedIn or my personal website, but I'm Bob Gillespie - Managing Partner of REACH Commercial at Second Century Ventures. You can find me on LinkedIn and I'm also** [**bob@thecaptableguy.com**](mailto:bob@thecaptableguy.com)**.**\n\nI've been in the startup, accelerator, VC world for 25 years. Happy to answer questions that interest me and are helpful to you.\n\nNot looking for anything in return, just thought I'd give back to the community some hard won knowledge. I'm pretty accessible in general.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nAny opinions are mine and mine alone and do not reflect anyone's other than mine.\n\nThe fund where I'm a managing partner invests in PropTech with adjacencies in InsureTech and FinTech primarily. I'm not really here for deal flow so not all that interested being pitched, but happy to help where I can on how VCs look at prospects.\n\nDon't be offended if I don't answer a question, it just means I don't have anything enlightening to say, don't know your vertical, or just don't have an answer worth typing. (Ex: \"How do I get more downloads on my app?\" I literally have no clue.)\n\nLet's have some interesting conversations.\n\nEDIT:  Really good time today with well over 100 questions/replies.  Signing off for now, but perhaps I'll do another in December or so!  Thanks all.  -G-",
