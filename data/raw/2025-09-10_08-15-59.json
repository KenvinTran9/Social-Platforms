        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "title": "6 Years to Build, 6 Months to Collapse - My Rant",
        "selftext": "  \nWe opened our brick-and-mortar shop in Florida about six years ago with a simple idea: create a small slice of Europe here in the U.S. We hand-select unique goods from countries like Portugal, Spain, France and Italy, and we‚Äôve worked hard to build a store that feels different, an experience, not just a shop.\n\nWith the exception of our first year, we‚Äôve grown 10‚Äì13% year over year. We‚Äôve spent countless hours curating products, learning international logistics, and figuring out how to import legally and efficiently. When we brought in containers, we paid all duties and taxes. For smaller shipments, the¬†*de minimis*¬†exception helped balance the books, letting us absorb the steep HTS rates on bigger imports. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it's been working.\n\nOur plan was long-term,¬† keep building until 2028, then decide to either sell the business or lease it. Instead, in the past six months everything has started unraveling. With the new tariffs in place, invoices from DHL and UPS are suddenly showing 30‚Äì75% duties on the entire purchase cost.\n\nThat kind of increase isn‚Äôt just a line item, it‚Äôs a death sentence for businesses like ours. We don‚Äôt sell ‚Äúneeds,‚Äù we sell ‚Äúwants.‚Äù Our shop is essentially an upscale gift store. Raise prices enough and customers simply stop buying. And with the economy already tightening and consumer spend way down the timing couldn‚Äôt be worse. We‚Äôve just had the lowest sales months since opening.\n\nHere‚Äôs the bigger problem,¬† this isn‚Äôt just my shop. Thousands of small businesses like ours rely on imports to bring cultural, artisan, and specialty products to U.S. customers. These aren‚Äôt luxury yachts or mass-manufactured electronics. We‚Äôre talking about olive oil, ceramics, linens, crafts, wines, the things that connect communities here to cultures abroad. If these products become too expensive to import, entire categories of small retailers will vanish.\n\nMeanwhile, large corporations with global supply chains will find workarounds. They can eat losses, spread costs, and negotiate deals. But independents like us can‚Äôt. We built something that took six years to establish, and it feels like it could collapse in six months, not because of bad business decisions, but because of sweeping policy changes that don‚Äôt distinguish between Walmart and a family shop.\n\nI don‚Äôt even know how to sell a business whose entire model is now in jeopardy. If importing becomes impossible, the value of everything we‚Äôve built goes to zero.\n\nFor all the talk of supporting small businesses, this is the reality. Policies like this don‚Äôt just hit countries on the other side of the tariff, they hit the small American businesses on Main Street even harder.",

        "selftext": "I recently saw a post here blow up mostly on tools that help with making money, where OP scrapped comments to find most mentioned tools that helped people make money. As an entrepreneur, I was more interested in tools used by entrepreneurs which helps run businesses betters!\n\nGiven the interest, i scraped another 25K+ comments across social media to see which AI tools are most mentioned in threads related to entrepreneurship! GPT 5 deep research were used to analyze the data. I also used semantic based filters to remove tools that weren't really relevant to running businesses!\n\n**Here‚Äôs the list:**\n\n1. **ChatGPT:** Super obvious why this is the top one. I use it daily for brainstorming etc. It even helped me create this report haha!\n2. **Claude:** Very similar to ChatGPT but some people tend to prefer this. Close contender\n3. **Perplexity**: Now this is more of a wrapper around other models but the major advantage is that its better for real time data- around things that are actively happening and changing around the works!\n4. **Bolt & Lovable:** Bolt and Lovable were tied as the most mentioned tools that help you create web apps and websites without having to write code using AI agents!\n5. **Cursor:** An full IDE that helps engineers and teams write code faster using AI.\n6. **Frizerly**:¬† An AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking.¬†\n7. **Google Veo**¬†\\- An experimental Google tool that makes short video clips based on text prompts you type in.\n8. **Windsurf:** Very similarly to Cursor but few people mentioned their Cascade AI agent was better at doing tasks end to end!\n9. **Clay**¬†\\- Software that runs automated outbound sales campaigns (like sending cold emails) and tries to handle responses the way a sales rep would.\n10. **V0 by Vercel**¬†\\- Software that runs automated outbound sales campaigns (like sending cold emails) and tries to handle responses the way a sales rep would similar to Clay.\n11. **Midjourney**¬†\\- An AI that turns written prompts into highly stylized images, mostly used for concept art, illustrations, or moodboards.\n12. **GitHub Copilot:** Similarly to Cursor and Windsurf but its a plugin that plugs into your existing IDE rather than a completely new IDE!\n13. **Playground**¬†\\- A creative sandbox for generating AI images and editing them with sliders, layers, and text prompts.\n14. **RunwayML**¬†\\- A video editing program that uses AI for things like removing backgrounds, adding effects, or generating clips from text prompts.I\n\nim sure some are missing so feel free to share them below and explain why you love using it :)",
