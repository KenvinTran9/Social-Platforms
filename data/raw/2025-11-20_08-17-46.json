        "selftext": "I do product sourcing consulting on the side. Small operation, just me, been doing it for two years. A potential client reached out last month saying she's a solo entrepreneur trying to launch her first product line but \"really struggling financially\" and could I please work with her at a reduced rate.\n\nI felt bad for her. We've all been there right? So I gave her 30% off my normal rate, brought my project fee down from $4500 to $3000. Told her I remember what it's like starting out and I wanted to help.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I'm helping her evaluate supplier quotes and she casually mentions she's trying to decide between putting 45k or 60k into her first inventory order. Then she's talking about her \"backup funds\" in case the product doesn't perform well.\n\nI didn't say anything but later I'm thinking wait, if you have 60k liquid to drop on inventory plus backup funds, why were you crying poor about my consulting fee?\n\nSo I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.\n\nShe straight up lied to me to get a discount.\n\nNow I'm sitting here feeling like a complete idiot. I gave her a discount because I thought I was helping someone bootstrap their dream. Turns out she was just negotiating and I fell for the sob story.\n\nPart of me wants to tell her I know and revise my rate back to normal for the remaining work. But we're halfway through the project and I already agreed to the price. Plus if she refers other clients to me that's probably worth more than the $1500 I'm losing here.\n\nBut I'm also pissed. I've turned down two other inquiries this month because I'm at capacity and I'm working with her at a discount while she's sitting on what looks like serious money.\n\nMy wife thinks I should just finish the project and never work with her again. My business partner thinks I should confront her because she disrespected my work and wasted my goodwill.\n\nHonestly I don't even know what the right move is here. I keep thinking about all the hours I'm putting in at a reduced rate while she probably thinks she played me perfectly. Maybe she did.",

        "selftext": "For more than a decade founders have been building the same categories over and over. Mobile apps, web apps, SaaS dashboards. All solid ideas in the past, but today these markets are so saturated that even excellent teams struggle to get noticed.\n\nWhat almost nobody is paying attention to is the new ecosystem emerging inside ChatGPT. Website traffic is already slipping because users simply ask their LLM to handle the task. And now that ChatGPT Apps exist, full applications with real UI and logic run directly inside the chat. If you are not familiar with them, just watch the announcement from OpenAI on YouTube.\n\nOpenAI will also introduce a full App Store for ChatGPT Apps at the end of this year. Here is the important part. ChatGPT can recommend and use apps automatically, even if the user never installed anything. Distribution happens inside the model itself.\n\nChatGPT has around 800 million weekly users. The Apple App Store had roughly one billion in 2025. The difference is that the ChatGPT App Store is still empty. No incumbents. No real competition. Opportunities like this are extremely rare and the potential is huge.\n\nMany categories can be rebuilt natively for LLMs. Shopping tools, price comparison services, booking engines, finance dashboards, workflow systems, enterprise products. None of the existing solutions can be dropped into an LLM unchanged, so the playing field resets. Anyone who understands this early can release an LLM native version of a proven model and become relevant before the established players react.\n\nYou do not need to outperform the incumbents. You only need to become visible enough to be a threat. When that happens, big companies will either hurry to catch up or eventually buy the challenger to protect their market.\n\nLearning how ChatGPT Apps and MCP work requires some effort, but the upside is entering a new market before everyone else shows up.\n\nIf you want to explore it, just google around. There are already resources and a few early tools that explain how to build these apps.",

I love her, but I also built this business before we even met, and I’m realizing I have no idea how people really blend their personal future with something they spent years building. Even simple conversations about money or longterm planning feel heavier than I thought they would.

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Every churn notification ruins my day. I started this because I wanted freedom. Instead, I built myself a job I can't quit. The Breaking Point Yesterday a customer asked for a feature that would take me 2 weeks to build. Another customer threatened to churn if I didn't add SSO this month. My payment processor flagged 3 accounts for review. And my girlfriend asked when I'm going to stop working at 11pm every night. The answer is never. Because if I stop, the whole thing collapses. I know what people will say: \"Hire someone!\" But hiring means giving up profit margin, dealing with management I've never done, and trusting someone else with my codebase. That sounds worse than the current situation. \"Sell it!\" To who? This is too small for acquirers and too dependent on me to fetch a real multiple. \"Just push through!\" For what? More money I don't have time to spend? Another year of 80-hour weeks? The Honest Truth I'm starting to think profitable isn't the same as worth it. Maybe I'd rather make $5K/month doing something I actually enjoy than $8K doing something that makes me miserable. Or maybe I'm just burned out and need a break. I don't even know anymore.
