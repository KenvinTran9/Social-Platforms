        "selftext": "\n\nI run a small residential roofing company (just me + 4 guys, doing around $40k/month) and there's one competitor who's always been our biggest rival in the area. We're cordial at supply shops but definitely competing for the same jobs.\n\nLast week I found out (through our shared insurance broker, long story) that they've been straight up lying to clients about having a general contractor's license. Like they claim to be \"fully licensed and insured\" on their website, truck wraps, everywhere. But they're not. At all. Never have been. I checked the state licensing board myself - nothing under their business name or the owner's name.\n\nThe kicker? Three of their current clients are homeowners I gave quotes to in the last 6 months and lost the job to them. One lady SPECIFICALLY told me she went with them because \"they seemed more legit with all their certifications\" and she felt safer. These are $15k-30k jobs btw.\n\nNow I'm sitting here like... do I say something? Part of me wants to send a \"hey just fyi\" message to those homeowners because like, if something goes wrong on their roof and the guy has no license, their homeowner's insurance might not cover it?? But another part of me feels like that's sketchy territory and I'll just look like a salty competitor trying to poach clients.\n\nMy lead guy says absolutely not, \"let karma handle it\" and it'll eventually blow up in their face anyway. My wife thinks I have a moral obligation to say something, especially since unlicensed work can void warranties and insurance claims.\n\nBut also like... they're literally breaking the law and winning contracts because of it. In our state you NEED a contractor's license for jobs over $10k. This isn't just shady, it's straight up illegal, right?\n\nThe thing that's really eating at me is one of those clients is an elderly couple on a fixed income who scraped together money for a roof replacement. They're getting scammed by someone who might leave them with zero recourse if something goes wrong. That one bugs me the most.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I'm losing sleep over this and honestly just need some outside perspective from people who get it.",

That way the contract would match the W9, with both listing my LLC. \n\nAny thoughts?",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me.

It adds 3 clicks to something doctors do 40 times a day. One cardiologist pulls out a spreadsheet proving the app will cost him $47k annually in lost patient time.\n\n2. Treat HIPAA like just another checkbox\n\nClick \"yes\" on a compliance form and genuinely believed that made the app secure and complaint. Learn about what it actually means in compliance review.\n\n3. Someone named O'Connor tried to log in\n\nEntire app crashes because some one forgot apostrophes exist in human names. The devs spend the next week learning about characters like Renée, Smith-Jones, and people whose entire legal name is just \"Cher.\"\n\n4. Show it to one doctor, product market fit confirmed.\n\n5. Epic wanted $25k just to have a conversation\n\nAssumed integration would be easy, Googled \"Epic integration\" and laughed at the $25k price tag, thinking it was a typo. It wasn't. Eight months later you get approval, and the app still crashes when it receives any data because integration testing is apparently a different $25k.\n\n9. AWS bill went from $500 to $15k, app hasn't launched yet\n\nTurns out HIPAA compliant infrastructure has opinions about encryption, logging,  and redundancy. Hospitals want you to sign SLA guaranteeing 4-nines. You hired a DevOps person at $12k/month because everything kept breaking and risk breaking the SLA. You've burned $220k and still don't have a single paying customer.\n\n10. They said \"this doesn't fit our workflow at all\" and you realized workflow was a word you should have learned earlier\n\nYou built scheduling. You built messaging. You built a beautiful patient portal. None of it maps to how clinicians actually work. They have to see 40 patients a day. Your app makes that harder, not easier. You spent a year solving problems nobody had while ignoring the ones they actually face daily.\n\n\nBut remember to have fun!",
