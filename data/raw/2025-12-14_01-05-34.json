        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m a small business owner in the beauty industry (cosmetic tattooing / brows) and I’m looking for advice on how to handle a situation that has escalated beyond normal customer service.\n\nA 19-year-old client booked and received a permanent brow service. The pricing, policies, and consent forms were clearly disclosed and signed. During the appointment, I checked in multiple times, and the client specifically requested a very minimal result. I initially did more and removed strokes at her request. She also has a complimentary touch-up included if she wants additional fullness.\n\nPayment was made using her mother’s credit card (the service was a gift).\n\nAfter the appointment, the client herself did not contact me. Instead, her mother texted me angrily saying the price was “ridiculous,” called my business a scam, and said she was filing a chargeback. I submitted a full evidence packet (signed consent forms, before/after photos, appointment details, policies, etc.), and it appears the bank ruled in my favor.\n\nNow, after the bank decision, the mother has escalated. She has contacted me again - from a different phone number - demanding a refund within 48 hours and threatening:\n\n- Posting negative reviews and “blasting” my business on Google, Facebook, and Instagram\n- Reporting me to the BBB\n- Reporting me to state licensing boards\n- Using “connections” in the industry to harm my business\n\nShe has framed all of this as contingent on me issuing a refund.\n\nI have not heard from the actual client at all, and I have remained professional and brief, redirecting communication to the client herself.\n\nAt this point, this feels less like a service dispute and more like harassment or extortion. I have saved all messages and have not refunded.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Should I reach out to the client via phone call to understand the situation?\n2. Should I reply to the mother?\n3. What should my next steps be?\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar after winning a chargeback?\n\nI’m trying to handle this correctly and not make things worse. Any advice from business owners or legal-minded folks would be appreciated.\nThank you.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
