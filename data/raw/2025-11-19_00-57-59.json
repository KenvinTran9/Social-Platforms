Truth is, most people should just get really good at their jobs, negotiate better pay, and invest wisely.\n\nStarting a business isn’t the answer for everyone.

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

Idk, got a better term for that?).  \nPeople use it for explainers, ads, onboarding, whatever.\n\nI’ve spent years making videos the normal way - around 5,000 projects at this point - so I usually have a pretty good sense of what’s important when creating videos.\n\nBecause of that experience, I thought I already knew what the next feature had to be. Before I built anything, I was convinced Feature A was the obvious choice. It’s something that annoyed me nonstop when I edited manually, so it felt like the logical priority.\n\n# What actually happened\n\nI have a community of 1,000+ beta users at the moment.  \nSo, just to be safe, I asked a few dozen users to pick the feature that mattered most to them.\n\nAlmost none of them picked Feature A.  \nThey all went for Feature B.\n\nAnd in my head, I swear Feature B wasn’t nearly as urgent or critical as Feature A.  \nThat forced me to rethink things.  \n  \nFeature A really is a big problem - but I guess it mostly matters if you have a strong design eye or a lot of editing experience.  \nMost users simply never notice or care about it. They feel completely different friction much earlier.\n\n# What I ended up doing\n\nSo I built Feature B first, and users are using it non-stop obviously.  \nBut heck - no way I'm giving up on adding Feature A asap!\n\n# What I learned\n\nExperience is useful, but it also creates blind spots.  \nThe problems you automatically notice after 5,000 projects aren’t the same problems someone notices on their first or tenth use.  \nSometimes the thing you almost ignore ends up being exactly what your users actually need.\n\nAnyone else had their users completely flip their assumptions like this?",
