        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "For the last nine months I’ve been building a product, validating an MVP with real people, pivoting once, and asking myself if this whole journey was worth starting. I left a $140k/yr job for the uncertainty of building my own thing. The only constant was the problem I care about: since I was 12 I’ve wanted to mix technology with science-backed fitness, and now I finally am.\n\nWe launched a week ago for the whole world. There is a small but real trickle of paying users and recurring revenue ($1.8k MRR), and while it is nowhere near what I used to make, the sense of validation and the happiness lately are hard to describe. I am feeling 100x happier than when I was paid 10 times this.\n\nIf you are considering taking the plunge, my two cents: if you need the income, start as a side project. There are plenty of influencer gurus telling you to quit and stop being a “normie,” but living without a salary takes real mental strength. Questions pile up. Some days you will feel like it was not worth it. Other days, a tiny win will carry you for a week.\n\nNo pitch, no links. Just sharing my experience in case it helps someone who is on the fence.",
