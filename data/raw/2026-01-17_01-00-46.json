        "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years. Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

        "selftext": "A few months back, I finally sold my ecommerce SaaS for a decent exit after hitting $500K ARR in 8 months.   \n  \nTook me three tries to get there - the first two were complete disasters.\n\nThis whole thing was brutal. I'm talking thousands of hours, doing the same tedious tasks over and over, saying goodbye to weekends, constantly second-guessing myself, running tests that went absolutely nowhere. But it worked out in the end.\n\nNow I'm working on [this SAAS ](https://gojiberry.ai)(helps B2B companies find and contact high-intent leads), and if I had to do it all over again, these are the exact habits I'd stick to every single day to get to $10k MRR as fast as possible.\n\nI've screwed up in every way you can imagine:\n\n* Wasted 6 months building something nobody wanted\n* Created a \"brilliant\" product that nobody would pay for\n* Got 2,000 people on my waitlist but couldn't convert a single one to paid\n\nSo this is me paying it forward.\n\nIf you're just starting out, trying to get from zero to actual traction, just do these 5 things. Every day with no exceptions.\n\nYour brain's going to fight you on this. It'll whisper \"don't send that message,\" \"don't post that - you'll look like an idiot,\" \"it's beautiful outside, take the day off.\" Don't listen.\n\nGrowth happens when you're uncomfortable. Not when you're cozy.\n\nPush through that voice. Do the work anyway. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nHere are the 5 daily habits that actually move the needle:\n\n1. Send 20-30 LinkedIn connection requests to your ideal customers. Just 20 minutes. Do it manually. Pick the right people. Connect. Done.\n2. Message 20-30 people on LinkedIn. Don't sell them anything. Just talk. Ask questions. Share what you're building and see if they have the same problem.\n3. Send 20-100 cold emails 20 if you're writing them yourself, 100+ if you're using tools. Keep them short. Don't be pushy. Just start real conversations. The magic happens in your follow-ups - send 2-3.\n4. Comment on 10 Reddit threads in your space. Go where your customers hang out. Jump into \"looking for alternatives to X\" posts. Actually help people. Only mention your product when it genuinely fits. People can smell fake help from a mile away.\n5. Post something on LinkedIn every day. This builds up over time. Write about problems your customers face, share what you've learned, tell quick stories about wins and losses. Give away good stuff for free. Build your lead magnets into the content. Just show up consistently.\n\nAt the beginning, it feels pointless.\n\n* 1 like on your posts\n* 1 response for every 20 messages you send\n* Radio silence on your first batch of emails\n\nBut stick with it every single day, and things start to compound.\n\nYou get better at writing. Your messages start working. People begin to recognize you. Someone books a call. Then 2 more. Then 10. Then they start referring people.\n\nThat's how you actually win. Not by getting lucky, but by showing up every day.\n\nEven when it's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nThe boring stuff is what actually grows your business.\n\nTrust me, it's worth it ! ",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "I struggle with this too. Freelancers have to deal with much more marketing/sales stuff.\n\nOn top of that, tax bureaucracy as a freelancer is a ton of work compared to a regular employee. This is even worse in earlier years of this new career path.\n\nFreelancing is also more stressful than a regular job so we need more downtime and relaxtion hours than a regular employee\n\n\nI don't want to quote a specific number. But weekly billable hours for a freelancer should be:\n\n> 40 hours - Hours required for extra side work - Few more extra relaxation hours",
