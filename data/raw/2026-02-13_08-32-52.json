Like, this was 100% intentional.\n\nOnce I actually de-obfuscated it, here’s what it was capable of:\n\n\\- Full file system access\n\n\\- Detecting the user’s home directory\n\n\\- Dynamically constructing file paths\n\n\\- Reading any file it had permission to read\n\n\\- Base64-encoding file contents (to hide what’s being sent)\n\n\\- Sending that data out via POST requests to remote servers\n\nTranslation: **if you ran it, assume your machine was compromised.**\n\nIf you are new here:\n\n* NEVER run client code blindly\n* Obfuscated JS = malicious. There is no legit reason for it here.\n* If a client says “just test it locally,” stop and think\n\n  \nI’m posting this out of pure rage because I don’t want another new dev to learn this lesson the hard way like I did.",

        "selftext": "We have a team of about 35 people and sales were going pretty well. One rep in particular was crushing it, consistently hitting 150% of quota, closing deals the rest of the team couldn't. When we decided we needed a sales manager, promoting him felt obvious. He knew our product, clients really loved him, and the team respected him.\n\nThree months in and everything was falling apart. The other reps were frustrated because he couldn't explain what he did differently; he just \"knew\" when a deal would close. Pipeline reviews were useless, he'd say things like \"this one feels good\" instead of actually coaching them. Two people from our team quit because they said they weren't learning anything. The worst part was that he was miserable, too. He missed selling and hated the administrative stuff.\n\nWe ended up moving him back to sales and hiring an actual sales leader from outside. Someone who'd built processes before, knew how to train people, and could look at data and spot patterns. It costed us about six months of momentum and probably $100K in lost deals while everyone was confused about who was running what.\n\nThe lesson for me was that your best performer is rarely your best manager. Those are completely two different skill sets. I wish I'd just hired someone with management experience from the start instead of assuming \"good at sales\" meant \"good at leading sales.\" Live and learn, I guess.\n\nHas anyone else made this mistake, or just us?",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",
