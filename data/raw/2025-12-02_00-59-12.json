Also here's a team plan that might fit better.\" Give them a path to compliance.\nEnforce strictly. \"Our records show X users, please upgrade or we'll need to restrict to licensed seats.\" Might lose them entirely.\nGrandfather them at current rate but lock it in. \"Your price stays the same but we're implementing device verification going forward.\"\nI genuinely don't know the right move here.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai) in May, and we made around $34K in November\n\nIt hasn’t all been smooth sailing, so I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently.\n\nQuick disclaimer: when I started this SaaS, I had zero audience in the niche I was targeting. However, I already had experience in SaaS, having built and sold one that reached 500K ARR pretty fast. So I knew how to handle a team, find a CTO cofounder, etc.\n\nIt’s definitely not easy. The first months mean no salary and constant reinvestment. Without experience and being solo, building a SaaS feels almost impossible.\n\nFor me, it’s a “second stage” business, something to do once you already have some money and security.\n\nToday we have over 300 customers and more than 30,000 monthly website visits. Here’s how we got there.\n\nWhat didn’t work: Twitter is still super slow, my account didn’t take off. SEO is super slow; we spent quite a bit on articles, but results take time. Cold calling also wasn’t worth the effort.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n\\-Reddit brings about 30% of our traffic. We post daily across subreddits, mixing value posts, resources, and updates. It drives a lot of volume, though conversion rates are moderate. (You probably saw us a lot on Reddit... yes... it works !)\n\n\\-Outreach is our top conversion source. We use our own tool, to find high-intent leads showing buying signals on LinkedIn, then reach out via LinkedIn and cold email. We send 3000 emails per day + as many linkedIn invitations as we can.\n\nWe get 3-5x more replies by email and on LinkedIn with our own tool compared to when we used Apollo or Sales Indicator databases. Using your own tool is honestly the key to building a successful SaaS, you always know exactly what needs to be improved.\n\n\\-LinkedIn inbound works great too. We post daily, and while it brings less traffic than Reddit, the leads are much more qualified. We use 3 accounts to post content. Some days it can bring us 10 sales.\n\nOur magic formula is 3k emails sent per day + 1 LinkedIn post per day + 5 reddit posts per week.\n\n\\- Our affiliate program has also been strong. We offer 30% recurring commissions, and affiliates have already earned over $3K. The key to a successful affiliate program is paying your affiliates as much as possible and giving them a full resource pack so it’s easy for them to promote your tool including videos, banners, ready-to-post content, and more.\n\n\\-Free tools worked incredibly well too. We launched four and shared them on Reddit and LinkedIn, which brought consistent traffic and signups every day. It’s pretty crazy because we put very little effort into it, yet every day people sign up for trials thanks to these free tools.\n\n\\- One big shift was moving from sales-led to product-led growth. Back in May, I was doing around 10 calls a day. It worked but wasn’t scalable. Now people sign up automatically, even while I sleep, and we only take calls with larger teams. It completely changed my life.\n\n\\-Influencer posts : We pay influencers to post about us on LInkedIn, it has been working really well. \n\nWe’re a team of three plus one VA, spending zero on ads. Our only paid channel is affiliate commissions.\n\nOur goal for end of December was 1m ARR. It will be less. We failed but it's growing.   \n  \nIf you have any questions, I’m happy to share more details and help anyone building their own SaaS.\n\nCheers !\n\n[Proof](https://gojiberry.ai/proof)",

        "selftext": "I was recently in NYC and stopped into one of the many small coffee shops in Manhattan, pretty close to Chinatown. A tiny storefront, just two tables inside plus some display shelves, a small case for baked goods, an ordering/serving counter. It might have been 150 square feet or so inside the customer area plus some room out back for making drinks. Coffee was $4 or so, a latte was $5, a croissant was $4 or $5, banana bread was $3. Hours are 8 AM to 7 PM, seven days a week.\n\nAnyway, it got me wondering how businesses like this stay open. With all of the competition plus the low per-customer revenue, how does a little place like this stay afloat in a big city? I assume the rent must be thousands per month. Do they need to own the space? Am I just not thinking through the math and not realizing that multiple small purchases a day add up? Are they running on a loan they'll never re-pay?\n\nI think about this a lot with random stores in cities. Like a little boutique-type store that sells funky little gifts, candles, greeting cards, etc. How does a place like that stay open in a presumably-desirable storefront area in a big city? Are there really enough people stopping in to support it?\n\nI guess the answer is obviously \"yes\" since they are open, but it doesn't make sense to me...",
