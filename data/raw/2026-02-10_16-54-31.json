        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "title": "I fired my biggest client and it was the best business decision I ever made",
        "selftext": "Last year I had a client that made up about 40% of my revenue. They were also the reason I was working 60+ hour weeks, constantly stressed, and slowly losing every other client I had.\n\nHere's what happened and why letting them go changed everything.\n\n**The situation:**\n\nThis client was a mid-size ecommerce brand. They paid well -- around $4,500/month. But they were absolutely brutal to work with. Scope creep on every project. \"Quick\" requests that turned into full rebuilds. Calls at 10pm because someone on their team had an \"urgent\" idea. And the worst part -- they treated every deliverable like it was never good enough, even when results were clearly there.\n\nI told myself I couldn't afford to lose them. 40% of revenue is a lot. So I kept bending over backwards.\n\n**What I didn't realize:**\n\nWhile I was spending 70% of my time on this one client (for 40% of the revenue), my other clients were getting the leftovers. Response times got slower. Quality dropped. I lost two smaller clients in the span of three months -- not because they were unhappy with results, but because they felt like they weren't a priority. They were right.\n\nI was also turning down new leads because I literally didn't have capacity. Looking back, I probably passed on $15-20K in potential annual revenue just because I was drowning in this one account.\n\n**The breaking point:**\n\nThey asked me to redo an entire month's work because someone new joined their marketing team and \"had a different vision.\" No additional pay. When I pushed back, they implied they'd find someone else.\n\nThat's when it clicked. I was running my business like an employee, not an owner. One client had all the leverage because I let them.\n\n**What I did:**\n\nI spent two weeks quietly lining things up. Reached out to old leads, reconnected with past clients, tightened up my processes. Then I had the conversation. Professional, respectful, but clear: we weren't a good fit anymore.\n\n**The aftermath:**\n\n- Month 1: Revenue dropped 35%. Scary as hell. But my stress dropped by about 80%.\n- Month 2: Picked up two new clients from referrals I finally had time to follow up on.\n- Month 3: Revenue was back to where it was, but spread across 5 clients instead of being dependent on one.\n- Month 6: Revenue was up 40% from my best month ever. And I was working about 40 hours/week instead of 60.\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n1. If one client is more than 25% of your revenue, you don't have a business -- you have a job with extra steps.\n2. Bad clients don't just cost you time. They cost you the good clients you can't serve properly.\n3. The fear of losing revenue is almost always worse than actually losing it. You adapt faster than you think.\n4. Your best new clients usually come from giving existing good clients the attention they deserve.\n5. \"I can't afford to lose this client\" is the most dangerous sentence in business. It means they own you.\n\nI'm not saying fire every difficult client. Some are demanding but fair, and that pushes you to be better. But if a client makes you dread opening your laptop in the morning, something needs to change.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar? Curious how others handled the transition.",

Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

        "selftext": "Venting here. Business partner for the past 5 years has up and quit. Demanded an insane payout, which was denied due to valuation not supporting it. Have countered with an offer that is grounded a bit more in reality while taking into account the massive risk I will be taking on as a solo venture. He's been less than pleasant about the whole ordeal, and has decided to just stop participating in operations while the payout is negotiated. A bit overwhelmed at the moment, mostly the books, as it has been his task to manage over the years. During the valuation, I discovered drastically inflated inventory assets and cash holdings. Have crawled the books trying to get everything proper but it's so overwhelming. How do you solo acts do it? Very impressive for single owner businesses to work, especially at the ground floor. I imagine in a year when I have more systems set up to support me and the business, it won't feel so catastrophic, but man, at the moment it's very intimidating and exhausting to even keep my head above water. Will be scaling back the entire business ad essentially rebuilding it brick by brick, this time without ay fuzzy back end details. It looks like a lot of nights in the future will be pairing panic attacks with whiskey haha.",
