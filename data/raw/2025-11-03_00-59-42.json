        "selftext": "Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space.\n\nAnyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing. \n\nI cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views!  \n  \nWhile running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic.\n\nAnyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down.\n\nEven with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything! And if anyone else here has gone viral with a product or business, how did you handle the surge? Did you manage to sustain it afterward?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "Okay so this is kinda wild. I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun.\n\nLast month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents.\n\nNow normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway.\n\nWhat I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up.\n\nHonest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook.\n\nI charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know?\n\nPlot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars.\n\nShe literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office.\n\nIf you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start. Real estate agents need basic stuff, not rocket science. Maybe do a cheap/free first project to get a testimonial and build confidence. These people have actual budgets if you save them time. You don't need to be some automation god, you just gotta solve an actual problem they have.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I'm just hyped because this actually worked. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this!",

        "selftext": "We opened up a music store a few miles from another music store that is focused on different things (we focus on school band instrument repair and rentals, other shop mostly does used gear and sells records) we are about as different as an automotive body shop is to an automotive mechanical repair shop. \n\nI have had only one interaction with the other store - he kicked me out and cursed at me when I went to deliver a package that was mistakenly delivered to us when we first opened. Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",

Write this down and stick it on your wall:\n\nMy target customer, [BE SPECIFIC], struggles with [A PAINFUL, SPECIFIC PROBLEM] and would pay to have it solved.\n\nA founder wanted to build a fitness app. Vague. He went to r/Fitness and realized what people actually hated was logging their workouts in confusing apps. His new hypothesis: “Gym goers who are serious about lifting struggle with clunky workout trackers and would pay for a faster, simpler way to log their sets and reps.” See the difference?\n\n**2. Run cheap experiments to prove yourself wrong.**\n\nYour goal here isn't to get a \"yes.\" It's to see if your idea can survive contact with reality.\n\n*   **The Landing Page Test:** Use Carrd or Notion to build a one page site. Don’t talk about features. Talk about the painful problem and the beautiful outcome your solution provides. Add a \"Get Early Access\" button that collects emails. If you can’t get 100 people to give you an email address, you sure as hell won't get them to give you a credit card.\n\n*   **The Manual 'Concierge' Service:** Sell the solution and deliver it yourself by hand. I know a founder who validated a complex B2B automation tool by running the entire service on Google Sheets and a bunch of Zaps for his first ten paying clients. They never knew. They just knew their problem was solved. He didn't build the real software until he had revenue.\n\n*   **The Social Media Smoke Test:** Post about the problem you’re solving on LinkedIn, Twitter, or a relevant subreddit. Don't pitch your product. Just talk about the pain. \"Anyone else hate how long it takes to [do X]?\" The responses will tell you everything. If people don’t even care enough to complain about the problem, they will never pay for a solution.\n\n**3. Read the results like a cold blooded realist.**\n\nLook at the data. A high email signup rate is a good signal. A bunch of people willing to pay you to solve the problem manually is an amazing signal.\n\nSilence is also data. Silence is a \"no.\"\n\nA lack of interest isn't a failure. It’s a cheap lesson. It’s a gift. Pivoting now costs you a weekend. A failed launch after six months of coding will cost you your savings and your sanity.\n\nStop treating your idea like a precious baby. Treat it like a lab rat. Put it through the maze. If it dies, you get another one. That's how you find the one that gets the cheese.\n\nWhat's the most expensive assumption you've ever made building a product?",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just need to get this off my chest because I’m honestly so frustrated with trying to make money. I started when I was 14, just looking for any way to earn online. I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great.\n\nI’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends.\n\nI even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers.\n\nI feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing.\n\nI’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it.\n\nSome nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal.\n\nI can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I know it’s not your problem, and maybe it’s annoying to read, but I just needed to say it. I’m 18, by the way.",
