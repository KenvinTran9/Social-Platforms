        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

        "selftext": "After watching a mind-bogglingly simple app cloning strategy video on Starter Story, I've gotten really into the app cloning space. *For the record, cloning isn't being a direct copycat - it can be finding what works, making it 1% better, cheaper, or applying to a different market.*\n\nI've been researching (what I think) is the best example of a crowded space where everyone is making money with only subtle variations on clones - **The Plant Identifier App** space.\n\n**8+ apps do essentially the same thing. They all make $100K-$13M/month.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the ecosystem works and some takeaways for how to apply the same strategies.\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → Get name → See relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $22M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# THE BREAKDOWN\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they were first in the space and are kings. \n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" (biggest numbers = perceived leader)\n* Latin pronunciation feature (tiny feature, but makes them seem sophisticated and as a \"serious botanical tool\")\n* Runs 300+ ads on Meta at any given time - crazy high adspend\n* $29.99/year pricing\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* First to go hard on paid acquisition\n* Obsessed with ASO - they rank #1 for every plant-related keyword\n* I've used it before (pre-LLMs) and it was impressive - made me go \"wow thats crazy\"\n\n**Clone lesson:** Be first and/or be willing to outspend on marketing\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Free for students and educators (viral growth in universities/social media)\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" (whatever the hell this is, but something for spiritual/astrology gardeners - different audience)\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature (human expert access)\n* Light meter tool (clever utility - measures if your spot has enough light)\n* Water calculator (another clever utility - tells you exactly how much)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Found audiences PictureThis wasn't serving\n* Free virality loop via social media\n* Added \"productivity tool\" features, not just identification\n* Ukraine-based team = lower costs\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't compete on the same features. Find an underserved use case or audience and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nBuilt by AIBY - a company that clones successful apps at scale.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't really\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n* They know paid acquisition better than most\n* Fast execution\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes you don't need differentiation, you just need solid distribution. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Launched in Turkish/regional markets first (less competition - an interesting strategy to discuss another day)\n* Better multi-language support\n* Expanded to English markets after proving the model\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded US expansion\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Targeted a completely different user base\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't start in the US. Start where it's cheaper to acquire users, then expand. Less rich users, but easier to capture market\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Won a Webby Award\n* Edible garden planning calendar (vegetable gardeners, not just houseplants)\n* Garden journal feature (track your plants over time)\n* \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" badge everywhere\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Awards = trust = \"this must be the best app\"\n* Carved out \"edible gardening\" niche that others ignored\n\n**Clone lesson:** Enter awards even if they're nonsense and get press. Social proof converts really well.\n\n# 6. Plantiary - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nAlso Turkey-based.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Again, very little differentiation if any\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n* 8th place in a market this size still = $100K/month (especially for Turkey)\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to win, just need to float in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Completely free. No ads. No subscription.\n* Open source, citizen science project\n* NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification\n* 68% accuracy (second-best tested)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Being free made them the \"recommendation\" pick\n* Scientists and serious botanists use it (prestige)\n* Press (and customers) loves recommending free alternatives\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They get grants, academic funding, and goodwill that pays off in other ways. I'm sure their employees are getting paid well.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30K/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Low overhead\n* $30K/month from a side project is still life-changing\n* Proof that even 10th place in a big market works\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to build a huge business. A \"small\" slice of a massive market is still significant.\n\n# THE PATTERNS\n\nLooking across all 8 apps, here's what actually creates differentiation:\n\n**1. Audience niching**\n\n* PlantIn → students\n* Blossom → vegetable gardeners\n* Same product, different positioning\n\n**2. One \"hook\" feature**\n\n* Moon calendar (PlantIn)\n* Ask a botanist (PlantIn)\n* Edible garden planner (Blossom)\n* Latin pronunciation (PictureThis)\n\nNone of these are hard to build or are groundbreaking, but certain people want them.\n\n**3. Social proof**\n\n* Awards (Blossom's Webby)\n* Press coverage (PlantNet in NYT)\n* \"Most accurate\" claims (PictureThis)\n\n**4. Geographic strategy**\n\n* Start in smaller markets\n* Build profitably\n* Then expand\n\n**5. Just showing up**\n\n* Plantiary and LeafSnap prove you don't need to be special\n* A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market\n\n# THE TAKEAWAY\n\n\"Competition\" in this large market means:\n\n* 8+ apps making $100K+/month\n* The leader makes $13M/month\n* The 8th place player makes $100K/month",

        "selftext": "B2B SaaS company. We are heavily dependent on creating personalised proposals/decks for each potential customer. Was using Notion for this but the proposal look super flat and boring + would like to not just send these over emails but also use it in 1:1 calls.\n\nWhat my decks usually contain:\n\n* Team + existing customer slide\n* Value proposition slides/ product slides\n* Case studies\n* Competitor comparison\n* Pricing\n* Client-specific customization\n\nSo far I have liked these tools:\n\n* Pitch - seems more focused on pitch-decks though but analytics is superb, planning on taking a subscription as an add-on for the post deck creation journey\n* Beautiful AI - large template library which makes design easier but seems super expensive + AI capability is limited\n* Alai - I found this sometime back and have actually used it quite a bit on Claude via its MCP, w.r.t scale and ease of use I found this fitting closer to my needs\n* Prezi AI - They have a zoomable canvas which is pretty crazy and unique but I also feel it makes it tougher to work with and while it is fun to work with it can be difficult to navigate\n\nAlthough I have a tool I want to go forward with shortlisted, I want to explore all my options before locking in for such a repetitive use-case.\n\nSales leaders/Founders/Marketers who've used an ai ppt tool - what actually stuck? Main concern is ending up with decks that look obviously AI-generated, which kills credibility in deals. Also want to optimize for automation eventually.\n\nBonus points if you've found prompts or workflows that help.",
