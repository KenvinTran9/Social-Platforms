The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "title": "You WILL Reach $20K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine)",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you’re doing great.\n\nToday I’ll show you exactly how you can reach $20K MRR for your SaaS just by structuring your acquisition properly.\n\nMost SaaS founders are like beginner chefs. They have all the ingredients like LinkedIn, Reddit, email, and YouTube, but no idea how to cook the dish. You already know LinkedIn is free, YouTube is free, and sending DMs costs almost nothing. But if you don’t know how to organize your day and what to do in what order, you’ll never get consistent signups or sales.\n\nHere’s how you can structure your days to drive traffic and sales. This is the same routine that brought me to over $20K MRR (twice)\n\nI use five main channels: LinkedIn outbound, cold email outbound, LinkedIn inbound, Reddit inbound, and YouTube inbound. Blog and affiliates can come later, but these five are the foundation.\n\nEvery morning starts with LinkedIn outbound. Once your profile is ready with a clear banner, headline, and offer, send around 25 to 30 targeted DMs. The secret is to avoid random scraped leads and only contact people in your niche who have shown intent or activity in the last 48 hours.\n\nFor example, if you sell a cold email tool, reach out to founders who recently liked or commented on posts about cold email. They already understand what you do and are much more likely to reply. At first, do it manually, then automate later. Always reply to your DMs from the day before.\n\nNext comes cold email outbound. We send around 3000 emails per day with proper deliverability. My daily process is simple: reply to yesterday’s emails, add new leads, and check or adjust campaigns. Find leads the same way as on LinkedIn by focusing on people who are already interested in your topic. When you do this, reply rates and meeting rates go up fast.\n\nOnce my outbound systems are running, I move to inbound. On LinkedIn, I post once per day. I create a resource or insight my audience really wants and tell people to comment if they’d like to get it. They comment, I DM them, we talk, and that’s how deals start. If you want to save time, find posts that already perform well, paste them into ChatGPT, explain your offer, and ask it to rewrite them for your niche. It’s the fastest way to publish content that gets attention.\n\nOn Reddit, I post every two or three days. I tell my story, share real experiences, and explain what worked for me. Authenticity always wins here and drives qualified traffic to your website.\n\nOnce a week, I focus on YouTube. I record five or six videos built around long-tail keywords. I don’t try to chase subscribers. Instead, I create videos for specific search terms that my ideal buyers are already looking for. Every video becomes a small inbound funnel that keeps bringing traffic over time.\n\nAfter that, there’s still product work, customer support, and everything else that keeps the business running. But this exact acquisition routine took me from zero to over $20K MRR in just a few months.\n\nIf you stick to it, you’ll start seeing results too.\n\nAnd if you want the full detailed free guide with templates and workflows on how to get to 20k MRR fast, [it's available here](https://www.notion.so/How-to-reach-10k-MRR-for-your-SAAS-286b9abcbe3f805fb469d503e584e172?source=copy_link). \n\nCheers !",

Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

People don't seem to understand I do not have billions in capital like Walmart or Amazon to allow anyone to return anything for any reason. Even Amazon is cracking down on returns due to the increase cost/frequency of returns since the pandemic. \n\n2. Rather than looking up or checking with me if an item will fit their vehicle, they just assume it will since I have to offer returns. 3 returns in 1.5 months simply due this this. Personal accountability has gone out the window. \n\n3. I do get the option sometimes to deduct from their refund, especially if they sent it back used when it was sold as new, and anytime I do, they bitch and moan about how unfair I'm being. If I sold something and it did not end up working somehow, or arrive damaged, I'm not going to do that, but if you buy a brand new car part that you did not check to see if it would fit, and literally try to force it and then damage it, then that's on you.\n\nI've tried to explain to people I can't keep prices low and allow people to just return something all the time and the recuperation of funds has to come from somewhere, but they simply do not understand nor care. If all retail businesses doled out nearly $1T in refunds last year, where do you think that money is going to come from? YOU, in the form of higher prices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "\"Check out my SaaS directory list\"  \nNo one cares.\n\n\"I Hit 10k MRR in 30 Days: Here's How\"  \nStop lying.\n\n\"I created an AI powered chatbot\"  \nNo, you did not create anything.\n\nMost projects we see here are completely useless and will not exist for more than a few months.\n\nAnd the culprit is you.  \nYes, you.  \nThe one who thought a new SaaS fully written by Cursor would magically take off because it used NextJS, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and five different cloud platforms you do not even need.\n\nAI sped up coding. It did not give anyone taste or judgment.  \nWe saw this before with crypto, NFTs, dropshipping, and now AI.  \nNew buzzwords, same hollow execution.\n\nThe videos telling you to \"Use AI to build your next million dollar SaaS\" will not make you a million.  \nThe only people making money are the ones selling the dream. They do not need expertise. They only need you to believe you are one prompt away from success.\n\nWhat actually works is boring.  \nSlow.  \nUnsexy.\n\n→Identify problems you deeply understand.  \n→Use your own lived experience to solve them.  \n→Learn skills that compound over time.  \n→Create value long before you think about monetizing.\n\nMost people skip this and jump straight to building. That is why their stuff dies.\n\nA question I started asking myself this year changed things for me:\n\nWhat do I understand better than most people around me?\n\nFor me, it was helping founders nail X & LinkedIn.\n\nNo algo hacks.  \nNo fake engagements.\n\nJust showing up consistently and writing in their own voice.  \n  \nI kept doing it for free and eventually turned it into Brandled.  \n  \nNot because I wanted a SaaS.  \n  \nBecause I already understood the problem.\n\nAsk yourself the same questions:\n\nWhat are you genuinely good at?  \nWhat problems feel natural for you to solve?  \nWhat skills can you keep improving for the next five years?\n\nStop building for the sake of building.  \nBuild with purpose.  \nAnd if your purpose is money, start learning sales and distribution.",
