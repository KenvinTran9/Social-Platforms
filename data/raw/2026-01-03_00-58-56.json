Instead of just dropping the price like I normally would, I was honestly just tired and broke down exactly what everything cost. Like I showed them the supply costs, explained labor hours, even mentioned that I keep some money saved aside (like $7k from Stаke) for equipment replacements that I factored into pricing.\n\nThey ended up booking it AND referred their realtor to us. Now I do this with most estimates when people seem hesitant and my close rate went from like 40% to almost 70%. People seem to actually appreciate seeing where their money goes instead of just getting a final number.\n\nI thought being transparent would make me look amateur or unprofessional but its been the opposite. Had a property manager last week tell me she went with us specifically because I \"didn't treat her like an idiot\" when explaining costs.",

        "selftext": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

Use AI and libraries. That's good business. \nBut if you are building a \"Shrine\" (a core system) to last 20 years, the cheapest way is actually \"**The Forging**\" (鍛錬) way. In Japan, the best katanas are forged by folding the steel thousands of times. Software is the same. You must fold the logic again and again by building from scratch until it becomes part of you.\n\nI see many startups drowning in \"Technical Interest.\" They take \"loans\" by using easy AI code without understanding the core. In banking, a loan without a repayment plan is just a disaster.\n\nIn Japan, we have a concept: \"Chiko-Goitsu\" (知行合一). Knowledge and action are one. \nReading about code isn't enough if your hands move slower than your brain.
