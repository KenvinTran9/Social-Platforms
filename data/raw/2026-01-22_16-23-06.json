        "selftext": " Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -> mediation -> arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",
