Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "Two years ago we decided to test an idea.\n\nWhat if we built a small native Trello power-up ‚Äî simple, clean, and entirely dependent on the marketplace? Could it turn into a small business? Could it be a model for side projects?\n\nIt took off fast. 30,000+ installs, thousands of daily users, and today‚Äîover 500 paying customers.\n\nSounds good, right? Not really.\n\nOn the bright side ‚Äî Trello is a fair ecosystem. Even small developers get discovered. No downranking, no hidden boost for ‚Äúbig players.‚Äù Clean UI guidelines, seamless integration, no middlemen, no 30% commission. Just connect Stripe and go. A perfect playground for a polished mini-product.\n\nBut then reality set in.\n\nWe priced it simply: $10 per workspace. Flat. Unlimited people, unlimited projects.\n\nSounds fair? Turns out even $10/month was a huge barrier.\n\nWhen it was free, growth was fast and constant. Teams used us daily for months, sometimes a year, leaving feedback and spreading love. But the moment billing kicked in, many vanished overnight. Even companies with 30+ users preferred something clunky and unsupported over paying the cost of 2‚Äì3 cappuccinos.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: for us, it‚Äôs hard to stay motivated supporting free users‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre bootstrapped.\n\nPaying customers energize you. Free users don‚Äôt.\n\nToday the project have 500 paying customers, and we‚Äôre happy to support them. The power-up pays for itself. It was always an experiment. And the gap between expectations and reality is what made it valuable.\n\nMy biggest lesson? Charge early.\n\nOnce people get used to ‚Äúfree,‚Äù that becomes the baseline. Asking for money later feels like betrayal. It‚Äôs paradoxically easier to charge upfront (after a short trial) than after a year of free use.\n\nSo, can a trello power-up be a real business?\n\nYes ‚Äî if by business you mean a side project that sustains itself, serves a few hundred happy customers, and brings in some cash. But not if you expect it to become a standalone SaaS company.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes the biggest win isn‚Äôt revenue ‚Äî it‚Äôs the lessons.\n\nHave you faced the same wall with free users? How did you handle it? Share your experience‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to compare notes.",
