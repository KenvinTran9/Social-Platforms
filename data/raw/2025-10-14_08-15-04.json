        "selftext": "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI own a burger joint that I've been running for 6 months now. Since day one, I've been giving a free burger to a homeless guy who comes in 3 times a week. I've always been happy to help him out, but last week, things took a turn.\n\nHe came in on a Saturday, and I had to tell him I couldn't give him a free burger because I was running low on product. I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",
