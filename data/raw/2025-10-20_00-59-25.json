        "title": "Creative Ways I’ve Bought Profitable Businesses with Limited Capital (2025)",
        "selftext": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn’t have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don’t care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They’re not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they’ve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I’ll call or email the owner and say something like, “Hey, I’ve followed your business for a while and really respect what you’ve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you’ve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.” That’s it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I’ve used seller financing in nearly every deal I’ve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don’t have the down payment, I find a partner who’s comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I’ll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They’ll tell you exactly how they think. That’s free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren’t really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don’t. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I’ll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here’s what I’d do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you’ll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn’t magic. It’s process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I’m happy to share what’s worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI joined a Series-A startup recently as a tech lead. On paper, the vision sounded amazing. It's  a super-flexible platform meant to work for any company, in any industry.\n\nThe pay is good and the people are nice. \n\nBut two weeks in, here’s what I’m seeing:\n\n1. Trying to do everything:\nThe founders want to build something that works for everyone, across every possible use case. There’s no clear niche or focus. Just “we’ll handle all kinds of clients.”\n\n\n2. Product constantly breaking:\nThey trying to bring all in one app. The system works with few demos, but when setup or real customer data is in progress, it breaks. Every new customer is unique in their requirements, and instead of saying no or prioritizing, the team feels compelled to make it bespoke which ruins other parts of the product.\n\n3. Fragile technical foundation:\nManagement is very non-technical. There's constant pressure from sales to \"just make it work.\" Many clients pay less than 1000 dollars but every single one demands high-touch service. (Its more VC money than customer revenue)\n\n4. Burnout and team fatigue:\nThere have already been some people who've left. The ones remaining all appear to be exhausted (and annoyed). Most dev work is outsourced to contractors and have 4 or 5 engineers in office. They are aggressively hiring without any plan. \n\n5. No actual forward progress:\nEvery week is a new fire drill. New clients come in, something breaks, quick fix, another feature breaks and it goes on. They rely on vibe code shortcuts and one-off hacks, so debugging and ownership are very difficult. \n\n\n\nI’ve been here barely two weeks, and people are already holding me accountable for issues that have existed for months.\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\n1) Is this kind of chaos normal for a Series-A startup?\n\n2) Has anyone ever witnessed a horizontal \"serve-everyone\" product plan come to reality?\n\n3) If you were standing in my position, would you stick around to try to steer it or cut losses early before getting dragged down with it?\n\nWould really appreciate some honest thoughts from people who have been in this position.\n\n(I will not promote)\n",
