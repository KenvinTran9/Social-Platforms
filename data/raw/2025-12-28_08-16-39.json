        "selftext": "So here’s the story.\n\nI was looking at some car accessories and kept seeing the same products priced at what felt like a crazy markup. Out of curiosity, I started digging into Alibaba to see what the actual manufacturing cost looked like. After a decent amount of research into suppliers, reviews, and verifying the manufacturer, I pulled the trigger on one unit.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was honestly expecting stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff quality. But it wasn’t. The build quality was on par with the name-brand US versions I’d been comparing it to.\n\nJust for fun, I threw it up on Facebook Marketplace to see if there was any interest. The response surprised me. My all-in cost including shipping was around $1,200. Comparable products were selling locally for $2,500+. I had multiple inquiries within days.\n\nSo now I’m testing it for real. Bought a few more units, planning to flip them. If it works, I’ll open an LLC and do everything above board.\nHere’s where my background helps: I work in logistics, so I’ve been able to optimize shipping and cut some costs that I think most people wouldn’t know how to avoid. I’m wondering if that gives me a legitimate edge, or if this whole space is so saturated that margins get crushed the moment you try to scale.\n\nMy questions for this community:\n\n\t∙\tIs the “Alibaba to local resale” model played out, or are there still niches where this works?\n\t∙\tDid I just get lucky with this particular product category, or is there a repeatable process here?\n\t∙\tFor those who’ve done this: what’s the capital requirement to actually make it a real business vs. a side hustle?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s tried this, whether it worked or didn’t. Not looking for validation; just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing seriously or if I should just enjoy the quick wins and move on.",

I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

        "selftext": "I’ve built MVPs for over 30 founders. And the number one reason I see startups run out of money isn't bad marketing.\n\nIt’s **\"Resume Driven Development.\"**\n\nThat’s when a developer convinces you to use the newest, hottest, most complex technology stack because *they* want to learn it to pad their resume, not because your business needs it.\n\nI see pre-revenue startups running on Kubernetes clusters, microservices, and experimental graph databases. They are spending $1,000/month on cloud bills for 5 users.\n\nWhen I come in to build an MVP, I have a strict rule: **We use Boring Technology.**\n\nHere is why \"Boring\" is the best investment you can make:\n\n**1. Boring doesn't break at 2 AM.**\nI use stacks that have been around for 10+ years (like a standard SQL database and a monolith backend). Why? Because every edge case has been solved. When your first customer tries to pay you, you don't want an \"experimental\" library handling the credit card. You want the thing that has processed billions of dollars already.\n\n**2. Boring is cheap to hire for.**\nIf I build your MVP using some obscure, trendy framework that came out last month, you are stuck with me forever. Nobody else knows how to fix it.\nI build using standard, popular tools. That means when you grow, you can hire a junior developer to take over my work easily. I literally engineer myself out of a job, because that’s what is best for *your* business.\n\n**3. Boring is fast.**\nI don’t waste weeks configuring complex cloud infrastructure. I spin up a boring server in 10 minutes. That means I spend the rest of the month building the features your customers actually pay for.\n\n**The \"Commercial Grade\" MVP**\nThere is a difference between a \"prototype\" and a \"product.\"\nA prototype is held together by duct tape.\nA product is simple, but solid.\n\nI don’t build prototypes. I build simple products on solid foundations.\n- I *do* cut scope (we don't need AI-powered avatars yet).\n- I *don't* cut stability (your database will be backed up, and your auth will be secure).\n\nFounders: Check your tech stack. If you can’t pronounce half the tools your dev is using, you might be funding their education, not your product.\n\nFellow devs: Stop over-engineering. The most impressive code is the code that makes money, not the code that uses the most buzzwords.",

So for example: Advertising - $2,500.  Insurance - $6,000 . Wages - $70,000.  The accountant then does my taxes based on all my numbers.  My spouse is telling me her friend at work who runs a small business just drops a shoebox full of receipts to their accountant and they and they do all the work.  Does anyone here do the shoebox method or just gives receipts?  That seems insane to me that an accountant would go thru a pile of receipts and just figure out what category they go in?  ",
