        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze.

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",

The business to me was genius because there are many people out there who either cant afford the full amount for a washer and dryer or they are only leasing a place for a year and don't want to commit to buy their appliances. It's also a good sell to people who have the space for washers and dryers and are tired of going to the laundromat. All service and repairs included in the rental so stress free for the client.

        "selftext": "If you read this post, churn will never be a problem again.\n\nWhy?\n\nI'm the founder of [dontchurn.io](http://dontchurn.io) and I have access to something you probably don't:\n\n**The exact retention data of 100+ SaaS companies (from $50K ARR to $25M ARR).**\n\nSaaS founders hire me to reduce their churn. So I get to see their real numbers.\n\nI watch them test different strategies. I see what actually moves the needle and what's complete BS.\n\nI have insights on churn most founders will never get.\n\n**Today, I'm sharing everything I've learned.** \n\nIf you're running a SaaS and retention matters to you (hint: it should), this might be the most useful thing you read this year.\n\n# 1. Not every market is born equal\n\nBefore you even think about churn tactics, know that your market/niche largely determines your baseline churn rate. \n\nHere are typical benchmarks for some key markets:\n\n* B2C mobile apps: 20-50% monthly churn\n* AI tools: 10-30% monthly churn\n* Sales/lead gen tools: 10-15% monthly churn\n* CRM: Under 5% monthly churn\n\nB2B generally has much lower churn than B2C.\n\n# 2. Find your \"retention point\"\n\nEvery customer has a \"moment of truth\" where they decide if they'll stay long-term.\n\nThis is your retention point - the specific moment when they experience your product's core value for the first time.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Stripe: When they process their first successful payment\n* Slack: When a team has their first productive conversation\n* Asana: When they complete their first project successfully\n* Salesforce: When they close their first deal tracked in the system\n* Canva: When a non-designer creates something that looks good\n\nOnce you know what this moment is, your job is to get customers there ASAP.\n\n# 3. Help customers get to the \"retention point\"\n\nRobert Skrob (author of '*Retention Point*') calls this the \"Member On Ramp\" - the series of steps customers need to take to reach the retention point or they'll churn.\n\nYou want the fewest possible steps, and make those steps as easy as possible.\n\n**Here are some ways to do it:**\n\n* **Create step-by-step checklists** \\- show exactly what to do first, second, third\n* **Provide templates/shortcuts** \\- eliminate friction to their first success\n* **Offer onboarding calls** \\- walk them through getting their first result\n* **Send targeted email sequences** \\- guide them toward that first win\n* **Build confidence** \\- show wins from similar customers throughout onboarding\n* **Milestone celebrations** \\- acknowledge every step toward the retention point\n* **Rewards** \\- bonus features or credits for completing onboarding steps\n\n**And the most important:** don't overload new customers with too much information. Give them baby steps toward their first win. Remove every element or information that doesn't get them closer to the retention point.\n\n# 4. The \"survivorship bias\" strategy\n\nLemlist's Guillaume Moubeche was stuck at $10M ARR until he realized his best customers (lowest churn, highest LTV) were sales reps/teams. He went all-in for them, even reducing the product's appeal to other segments. Result: his net churn dropped and Lemlist grew to $30M ARR in 2 years.\n\nThat’s the  \"survivorship bias\" strategy: instead of obsessing over churners (“why did they leave?”), study **the survivors** — the people who *stay forever*.\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n\n* Who are my best customers? (lowest churn, highest LTV, most referrals)\n* What do they have in common?\n* How do they use the product differently?\n* What behaviors do they show early on?\n\n**Then redesign everything for these people:**\n\n* Marketing: speak directly to this persona\n* Product: build features to serve them better\n* Onboarding: guide new users to behave like survivors\n\n# 5. Use smart cancellation flows\n\nA cancellation flow is a series of steps designed to give people reasons to stay instead of cancelling.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Step 0:** User clicks “Cancel my plan”\n\n**Step 1:** Offer to pause their plan (up to 3 months)\n\n**Step 2:** Offer a *50% discount* for 3 months if they stay\n\n**Step 3:** Trigger a smart survey (with conditional logic)\n\n* “*Too expensive*” → Offer 1 free month\n* “*Technical issues*” → Offerdirect access to technical support\n* “*I switched to another tool*” → Ask follow-up: “What do you find better?”\n* “*Missing features*” → Suggest switching to another plan“*Other*” → Ask a follow-up question\n\n**Step 4:** Remind the user what they’ll lose (saved content, credits, history)\n\nIf you want to add a super effective cancellation flow to your SaaS in 30 minutes, check out [dontchurn.io](https://dontchurn.io/).\n\n# 6. Recover failed payments religiously\n\nInvoluntary churn accounts for 20-40% of all customer churn. \n\nFor a SaaS company generating $10M ARR with 10% monthly churn, if 1/3 of that churn is involuntary, you're losing $4M annually just from failed payments.\n\n**You should have failed payment recovery campaigns in place:**\n\n* Create automated sequences via email/SMS that play on loss aversion and urgency: \"Update payment method: your account will be deleted in 3 days\" or \"You're about to lose access to \\[insert SaaS name\\].\" \n* Many customers will update their payment info within 24 hours when they realize what they're about to lose.\n\n# 7. Belonging beats benefits\n\nRetention is social, not individual. Most people quit products alone, but if your product ties them to social commitments, quitting means abandoning people - not just cancelling software.\n\n**Examples of social entanglement:**\n\n* Slack: Leaving means disconnecting from your team's daily conversations\n* Notion: Shared workspaces make you responsible for team documentation\n* Cohort-based courses: Missing means disappointing other classmates\n\n**How to build social hooks:**\n\n* Make cancellation affect other people (team workflows break)\n* Create shared assets (documents, projects, data) others depend on\n* Build community features (comments, group challenges)\n* Show \"team activity\" so users see they're part of something bigger\n\n# 8. Use targeted re-activations campaigns\n\nDon't let churned customers disappear forever. \n\nUse the exit survey data from your cancellation flow to create targeted win-back campaigns (via email and/or SMS) based on why they left:\n\n* **Price:** \"We miss you! Come back for 50% off your next 3 months\"\n* **Not using enough:** \"Here's a free onboarding call to help you get more value\"\n* **Missing features:** \"The feature you requested is now live - want to see it?\"\n* **Bad timing:** \"Ready to give us another try? Here's 30 days free\"\n* **Competitor switch:** \"See why \\[competitors' customers\\] are switching back to us\"\n\n**Best practices:**\n\n* Wait 30 days after churn (let the sting fade)\n* Send 2-3 emails/SMS spaced 2 weeks apart\n* Offer something valuable (discount, training, new features)\n* Make it personal: \"Hi \\[Name\\], we noticed you left because...\"\n\nWell-executed **win-back campaigns can recover 10-15% of churned customers** at 100% lower acquisition cost than finding new ones.\n\n# 9. Push annual plans like your life depends on it\n\nAnnual customers churn 3-5x less than monthly ones. \n\nThe math is simple: If your average monthly customer stays 6 months ($600 total), an annual customer paying $960 upfront (20% discount) gives you 60% more revenue + higher LTV + lower churn rate.\n\n**Other advantages of annual plans:**\n\n* **Fewer failed payments:** 12x fewer transactions = 12x less involuntary churn risk\n* **Cash flow now:** Get money today to reinvest vs. waiting 12 months\n* **Higher usage:** Commitment bias drives customers to use your product more\n\n**How to sell annual plans:**\n\n* **Discounts:** Offer 2-3 months free (16-25% savings)\n* **Exclusive features:** Annual-only access to exclusive features\n* **Free bonuses:** \"Get our $500 course free with annual signup\"\n\n**When to sell annual plans:** \n\n* **At signup:** Offer 2-3 months free for annual (most effective conversion point)\n* **After retention point:** When they've experienced value and are convinced\n* **Via email sequences:** Regular campaigns to monthly subscribers\n* **In-app prompts:** Show potential annual savings in billing section\n\n**Don't be shy:** Push annual plans constantly. Most customers need 3-7 exposures before converting. Your retention and cash flow depend on it.\n\n# 10. Re-affirm value\n\nChurn often happens not because customers don't get value, but because they forget the value they got.\n\n**How to remind the value:**\n\n* **Usage reports:** \"You sent 847 emails this month that would've taken 12 hours manually\"\n* **Before/after metrics:** \"Since using our tool: 67% faster response times, $12K saved\"\n* **Milestone celebrations:** \"Congrats! You've processed your 1000th payment with zero fraud\"\n* **Comparative data:** \"You're 3x more productive than the average user in your industry\"\n* **ROI calculators:** \"Based on your usage, we've saved you $47,000 this year\"\n\n# 11. Focus on net churn, not gross churn\n\nStop obsessing over who's leaving and start asking: who's expanding/upselling? \n\n**If you lose $10K from churned customers but gain $15K from expansions, you have negative net churn** \\- your revenue grows without new customers.\n\nThe best SaaS companies don’t just fight churn — they design pricing + expansion so that revenue from existing customers grows faster than they leave.\n\n**Types of upsells:**\n\n* **More seats:** Add users to existing plans\n* **Usage tiers:** Higher limits for API calls, storage, features\n* **Premium features:** Advanced tools, integrations, analytics\n* **Add-on products:** Complementary tools in your suite\n\nDesign your pricing for expansion, not just retention. \n\n# 12. Recognition and status \n\nCustomers stay when they feel seen and celebrated.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* LinkedIn Premium: that \"Premium\" badge boosts ego → retention\n* Airlines: ‘Elite/VIP’ status keeps people loyal even when cheaper options exist\n* ClickFunnels: \"2 Comma Club\" awards create tribal belonging\n\nPeople don't cancel when they're proud of their status.\n\n# 13. Build a brand people don't want to abandon\n\nStrong brands create emotional switching costs. Customers don't just cancel software - they abandon an identity they've built around your company.\n\n**Examples of brand-driven retention:**\n\n* **Notion:** People proudly share their workspace setups on YouTube and Reddit. Using Notion becomes a badge of creativity and productivity.\n* **Figma:** Designers wear Figma swag and joke about being in the “Figma cult.” Switching feels like betraying their tribe.\n* **Vercel:** Their strong product design + Guillermo’s thought leadership makes developers feel like they’re part of a movement, not just using hosting.\n\n# How to drive retention through branding:\n\n* **Show the founder(s):** Put a human face out front (e.g. Guillaume at Lemlist)\n* **Take a stand:** Share strong opinions on industry debates to attract believers\n* **Build community**: Give users spaces to connect with each other\n* **Stay consistent:** Use a distinct voice across emails, docs, support\n* **Share your story:** Post behind-the-scenes struggles and wins\n* **Unique design:** Create a visual identity that’s instantly recognizable \n\n# 14. Spend at least 30% of your time talking to your customers\n\nRetention starts and ends with building a product that truly changes people’s lives. And the only way to do that is to be close to your customers.\n\n* Talk to them every day — calls, chats, feedback sessions\n* If you’re B2B, make some sales calls yourself to hear what people need\n* Build a tight loop between support and product so insights don’t get lost\n\n**As a founder, you should spend at least 30% of your time talking to your customers.** \n\nNothing else will teach you more about what to build, fix, or double down on.\n\nSaaS stickiness comes from a great product. \n\nAnd a great product comes from listening — again and again — until you know your customers better than they know themselves.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you already know retention is the key to building a successful SaaS:\n\n* It’s the difference between a SaaS at $100K ARR and one at $100M+ ARR\n* It’s the difference between a flat growth vs double-digit growth\n* It’s the difference between a 2× and a 10× valuation multiple\n\nYou can ignore churn — but churn will not ignore you.\n\n**If you take just 2–3 of the principles in this post and actually implement them, you’ll already see churn rates drop.**\n\nIf this was helpful, please upvote so more founders can see it.\n\nDrop your questions or experiences in the comments: I’ll reply to everyone.",
