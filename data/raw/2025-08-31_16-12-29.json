        "selftext": "My last post here about side hustles absolutely blew up and is the 2nd top post in r/entrepreneur this year! Thanks guys!!!\n\nAfter that post blew up, my DMs got flooded with questions specifically about making money with AI.\n\ngiven the interest, i scraped another 25K+ comments across social media to see which AI tools are actually making people money or saving time.\n\nThis time grok and gpt 5 deep research were used to analyze the data. Scraped from YouTube, Facebook Groups, Instagram, TikTok, X and Reddit.\n\nHere’s the list:\n\n1. Beautiful AI - make professional slideshows in just a few clicks. People report saving tons of time and there are even those who sell a service of redesigning ugly slideshows and are using this to do the work.\n\n2. Suno AI - make insane quality music in just seconds. People are making jingles for companies. Others are making songs, releasing them through DistroKid, then earning royalties from Spotify and streamers.\n\n3. Vubo AI - make viral worthy vertical videos in under a minute. People run faceless channels and earn through Adsense and sponsorships. Others use the video templates to make viral videos to promote their digital products or affiliate offers.\n\n4. Browse AI - scrape and monitor websites without coding. Marketers are using it to build lead lists, researchers are selling data reports, and ecom owners are tracking competitor pricing automatically.\n\n5. Chatbase - make a custom AI chatbot trained on your own data. Freelancers are selling “done-for-you” chatbots to businesses that want 24/7 customer support, while solopreneurs use it to have world class customer support and boost sales.\n\n6. Instantly AI - send high-converting cold email campaigns that land in the inbox with ease. Some people sell done-for-you outreach as a service or use cold email to sell affiliate offers or generate leads which they sell to businesses.\n\n7. OpusClip - cut long videos into shorts and easily add subtitles. People use this to turn podcasts or long form video into tons of TikToks, shorts and reels. Video editors also sell clipping as a service to influencers and businesses.\n\n8. Indexly AI - submits your new or updated pages to Google and Bing so they get indexed in hours instead of weeks. Bloggers and ecom stores use it to grab traffic fast, while SEO freelancers resell “rapid indexing” as a service.\n\n9. Fireflies AI - automatically record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings. People use it to create detailed call notes and many report it makes them way more efficient.\n\n10. TryAtria - get ad inspiration from 25m winning ads, write better ad copy, and see what’s working right now. People use this to research competitors and create ad campaigns that convert better.\n\n11. Higgsfield AI - turn photos into videos with cool video effects, generate ultra realistic people, make avatars that speak, and lots more. Basically a creative suite for marketers, creators and beyond.\n\n12. StealthGPT AI - write human copy that is undetectable as AI and sounds like you. Many people report using this on school assignments, at work, and even in copywriting for their business. Many mentions in recent months.\n\nim sure some are missing so feel free to share your own ways to save time or make money using AI. If you guys find this post useful I will post a follow up next month.",

        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm Vincent, founder of Huzzler (a launch/community platform). Over the past few months, I've watched more than 1000 founders launch their products on my site.\n\nThere's a pattern I see over and over:\n\nMonth 1-6: Build incredible product  \nMonth 7: Launch to 12 users  \nMonth 8: \"Maybe I need more features?\"  \nMonth 12: Still struggling to get customers... -> panic\n\nThere's a common theme here. Almost everyone can build beautiful (and mostly effective) SaaS projects.\n\nThe mistake most founders make is thinking the building phase is the hardest part. It's not. Getting customers is.\n\nMost founders have no systematic approach of getting customers. They try random stuff, post around on product hunt, twitter but that's where they are wrong. Most B2B customers are not in the \"build in public\" or \"tech founders\" circles. They're employees at companies doing their jobs.\n\nSo I'm building  something called the \"Customer Engine\", a system that gives exact daily tasks for B2B SaaS founders to get their first customers. No more guessing what to do each day.\n\nInstead of: \"Should I cold email or try LinkedIn today?\". You get: \"Send 8 LinkedIn requests to marketing managers using template #3\". Plus a community where founders share what actually works (with real numbers). And the tasks are personalized to your buyer type and pricing model.\n\nWould love your thoughts on this. Would you use something like this? What would make this most valuable for you?\n\nWaitlist: [customerengine.co](http://customerengine.co)\n\n\n\nBuilding a product?

I got greedy.\n\nI was so obsessed with growth that I reinvested everything into:\n\nMore SKUs (chasing trends instead of focusing on winners).\n\nBigger ad spend (burning cash on campaigns I didn’t fully understand).\n\nHiring too fast (without systems in place).\n\nBy the middle of Year 3, cash flow was a nightmare. I was paying suppliers late, juggling credit cards, and losing sleep every night. On paper I was “7 figures”. In reality, I was broke, stressed, and 2 bad months away from shutting down.\n\nThe turning point was humbling: I had to let 2 people go that I’d hired too soon. It sucked. But cutting back saved me. I re-focused on 2 core products, killed the distractions, and stabilized cash flow.\n\nLessons I wish I knew earlier:\n\n1 - Revenue is vanity, cash flow is sanity.\n\n2 - Don’t scale what’s broken. If your systems don’t work at $100k, they won’t magically work at $1M. \n\n3 - Hiring = overhead. Hire slow, systemize first.\n\n4 - Growth feels good, but survival feels better.\n\nLooking back, scaling slower would’ve made me more money and saved me a lot of stress.\n\nHas anyone here also scaled too fast and regretted it?

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback after I had delivered everything - payment just got yanked back. 😩\n\nI’m shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I’m trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",

        "selftext": "at the start of 2025, I took the biggest risk of my life: I quit my job to become an indie developer. My goal was clear financial freedom. But the journey was way harder than ı imagined.\n\nThe first month was amazing. I'd wake up excited, thinking, \"what code am ı going to write today?\" By the second month, a bit of worry crept in. Money was trickling in but not enough. By the third month, real panic set in.\n\nFor 8 months, my daily routine was the same: wake up 8-9 am, code until 1 am coffe shops, home, libraries, sometimes even at 3 am, still glued to the screen. I debugged with tears in my eyes...\n\nDuring that time, I built dozens of apps: a todo app, sunsafe app, sunglow app, fitness tracker, habbit tracker etc... Each one I launched thinking... \"This time it'll work\". Most of them got 20-30 downloads a day for the first week. Then disappeared from the App Store.\n\nBy the 5. month, even my friends stopped asking abount me. If someone said, \"How are u?\" I had nothing to say except, \"Im working on a new app.\" birthday parties, weekend plans all gone... My social life was dead.\n\nMy family was worried. My mom said, \"Honn, this wont work, go back to ur job.\" My dad quietly started checking job listings for me. Deep down, I know they were right. But ı couldnt give up.\n\nB the end of the seventh mont, I had $400 in my bank account. Rent, bills, food... I could barely last one more month. I couldnt sleep, constantly thinking, \"should ı just applt for another job?\"\n\nI promised myself one last time. One more app. If this one didnt work, ı'd return to job. This time, I apprıached it diffrently. Instead of something complex, I focused on a simple problem people face every day: converting photos into proper PDFs.\n\nI named it **Photo to PDF & JPG to PDF**. I kept the interface as simple as possible. Every detail, every button, every animation, I reviewed ten times.\n\nEven getting approved by the app store was stressful. I didnt know what ı'd do if it got rejectet but luckily, it got approved.\n\nOn launch day, I had zero expectations. I was tired of dreaming. 50 downloads came in the first day. \"Same old story,\" I thought. The next day 200, the third day 400...\n\nBy the 4. day, when I oppened my revune dashboard, I couldnt believe my eyes: $5.290 earned. I closed the screen and reopened it, thinking it must be a mistake. It wasnt... Later, I even gave it away for free to some people on Reddit... and things grew from there...\n\nThat night, I finally slept peacefully for the first time in 8 months. The next morning, I called my parents and just said, \"It happened.\"\n\nI can’t even describe how I feel now. I had sacrificed everything for 8 months, fireands, social life, a stable income... gone. But now, for the first time, I feel like financial freedom is actually possible.\n\nWhy am I sharing this? Because giving up is easy. But sometimes, all it takes in one app working and ur life can completely change..\n\n  \n",
