        "selftext": "We have a team of about 35 people and sales were going pretty well. One rep in particular was crushing it, consistently hitting 150% of quota, closing deals the rest of the team couldn't. When we decided we needed a sales manager, promoting him felt obvious. He knew our product, clients really loved him, and the team respected him.\n\nThree months in and everything was falling apart. The other reps were frustrated because he couldn't explain what he did differently; he just \"knew\" when a deal would close. Pipeline reviews were useless, he'd say things like \"this one feels good\" instead of actually coaching them. Two people from our team quit because they said they weren't learning anything. The worst part was that he was miserable, too. He missed selling and hated the administrative stuff.\n\nWe ended up moving him back to sales and hiring an actual sales leader from outside. Someone who'd built processes before, knew how to train people, and could look at data and spot patterns. It costed us about six months of momentum and probably $100K in lost deals while everyone was confused about who was running what.\n\nThe lesson for me was that your best performer is rarely your best manager. Those are completely two different skill sets. I wish I'd just hired someone with management experience from the start instead of assuming \"good at sales\" meant \"good at leading sales.\" Live and learn, I guess.\n\nHas anyone else made this mistake, or just us?",

        "title": "Cousin’s fiancée wants 10% equity in my software company for one client introduction. Cousin is pressuring me to sign. Am I wrong for refusing? I will not promote",
        "selftext": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "I just spent my entire Sunday filming Instagram reels and I'm losing my mind.\n\nFreelance brand designer, three years in. Work is fine. But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",
