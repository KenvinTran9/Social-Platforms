It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

After months of silence, I stopped applying as aggressively and decided to finally act on an idea I’ve had for almost 5 years, to build something of my own and be my own boss.\n\nThat’s how my startup idea was born (still very early, mostly just me trying to make things work).\n\nSince then, I’ve tried everything I could think of:\n- applying for jobs\n- building a startup\n- posting on YouTube / Instagram (content cration)\n- learning, building, iterating\n\nAnd the result has been the same everywhere: almost zero response.\n\nNo users, no traction, no recruiter callbacks, no real encouragement.\n\nFriends and family don’t really support it (or maybe don’t believe in it). I don’t fully blame them, when there’s no visible progress, it’s hard for anyone to.\n\nNow I’m financially broke, mentally exhausted, and honestly demotivated. The stress has started affecting my marriage too, which hurts the most.\n\nI keep asking myself:\n- What am I doing wrong?\n- Am I approaching things the wrong way?\n- Is this just how it works before things click, or am I ignoring some obvious mistake?\n- How do you know when to persist vs when to pivot?\n\nI’m not posting this to promote anything or ask for sympathy.\n\nI genuinely want real feedback from people who’ve been through layoffs, failed startups, long job searches, or rebuilding phases.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place:\n- What helped you get unstuck?\n- What would you do differently if you were in my position?\n- Any hard truths I might need to hear?\n\nThanks for reading. Even writing this out feels heavy, but I figured honest questions are better than silent overthinking.",
