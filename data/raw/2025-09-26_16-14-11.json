        "selftext": "I have gone through past fraud related posts in this subreddit and I know all the comments say to get a lawyer.\n\nI have a lawyer and we have filed a lawsuit in court. I just wanted to hear anecdotal stories of similar experiences. How did it work out for you if this happened to you or someone you knew? Just talking about it when I can’t talk to anyone in real life about this will make me feel better.\n\nBefore I bought the restaurant, I hired an accountant to assist me with the due diligence. The seller gave us tax returns, profit and loss statements from their accountant, etc. I bought the assets of the company and started a new LLC, got a new EIN, etc to run it.\n\nThe restaurant is close to failing. I am months away from declaring bankruptcy and walking away. But only a few months ago I learned that the seller gave me fake numbers during due diligence. \n\nI don’t want to share too much but my lawyer thinks we have a pretty clear case of fraud, modifying documents to obtain money under false pretenses, and good, admissible evidence to prove it.\n\nI just know the legal process will take forever. I know the person I’m suing can leave the country and hide forever. I know what all the possible outcomes are, but I want to hear stories of what people have seen in real life good or bad.\n\nI found a case very similar to mine and it gives me hope:\n\nhttps://bc-llp.com/2930000-jury-verdict-on-intentional-misrepresentation-reported-by-verdicts-settlements/\n\nI found another case that is similar that it’s seller’s fraud in a business transaction but I don’t know the outcome of the trial or if damages were awarded to the plaintiffs:\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/2012/a3112-10.html\n\nThe person I am suing still has the money I paid them for this transaction. I just want that back plus attorneys fees plus my losses from operating this restaurant.\n\n\n\nEdit: How I discovered the fraud is I found the real copies of bank statements and 1099 from the payment processor company. Found these in a storage room.\n\nThese were the documents that they scanned and then photoshopped to show higher numbers. I am sure they forgot to shred these or something after committing the fraud. If I had not found these then I would have never known.\n\nThe seller reported the higher numbers on their tax returns to the IRS and their returns indicate this restaurant was making an okay profit. This restaurant doesn’t even take cash, which is one reason why I wouldn’t have suspected anything funny with the IRS back during due diligence. I assume the seller is laundering money but I don’t know how.\n\nIf the documents were not photoshopped, I wouldn’t have bought this restaurant. The unedited copies of the statements are all I have to prove fraud during due diligence.\n\n",

She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her.

She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

Things were going well and I was sharing a worksheet where I used to update him with every work that I do on social platforms.\n\nAfter 2 months the client paused the contract saying he wants me to update about work everyday. He said he was suspicious of my work. I felt bad but I made sure to be as transparent as possible. I was updating the worksheet late like 2/3 days delays and I worked on it. Then he demanded me to update a worksheet daily.\n\nThen I continued doing the work and sharing and updating the worksheet. After 1 month he has paused my contract again and saying that he is suspicious and shit when I have shared all the work I have put in, in the worksheet. Every link, every detail possible.\n\nHe is saying that he wants work report now and I have not sent him but in reality he had asked for work sheet.\n\nHe shared with me a WhatsApp Message saying that he had asked me for a work report. The message is suspicious because I don't remember it and it shows that the message is edited.\n\nHe has paused my contract and he has to pay me too. I told him that i can give him a report and I'll submit the report with all the weeks progress but he is arrogant.\n\nI'm not liking the fact that he is treating me like a scammer but in reality I've helped him and I've got solid results. Ive almost completed 99% of work and it's all positive.\n\nI don't know how to deal with him!",

        "selftext": "I'm a freelance video editor and I’ve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up — and I’m not sure how to break the cycle.\n\nThis is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything.",
