        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "title": "My client wants to buy exclusivity - what do we think?",
        "selftext": "\nMy business partner and I run a social media content  agency (2 years old, 17 active clients). One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent <20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

I told him that i can give him a report and I'll submit the report with all the weeks progress but he is arrogant.\n\nI'm not liking the fact that he is treating me like a scammer but in reality I've helped him and I've got solid results.

        "title": "I've built MVPs for 25+ startups and honestly most founders waste their money on the wrong things",
        "selftext": "So I run a dev shop and we mostly work with early stage founders. After 3 years of this, I keep seeing the same mistakes over and over. Writing this because I'm tired of having the same conversation.\n\n# The stuff that kills projects:\n\n**1. Feature bloat from day one**\n\nHad a founder last month come in with a 47-page PRD. Wanted user profiles, notifications, admin dashboard, analytics, social sharing, the whole nine yards. Budget was $40k.\n\nI asked \"what's the ONE thing this app needs to do?\" and he couldn't answer. Just kept saying \"but users will expect these features.\"\n\nConvinced him to cut it down to just the core workflow. Launched in 7 weeks instead of 6 months. Got 200 signups first week. Guess what? Nobody even clicked on half the features we almost built.\n\n**2. \"We need to handle a million users\"**\n\nNo you don't. You'll be lucky to get 50 users in month 1.\n\nI had a client insist on microservices, Kubernetes, the whole enterprise stack. Spent $120k and 5 months building. Launched. Got 31 signups. Pivoted 2 months later. All that infrastructure? Completely useless.\n\nMeanwhile another client launched with a basic Next.js app on Vercel. Cost $25k, took 6 weeks. Got 500 users in month 1. Still running on the same simple setup at 5,000 users.\n\n**3. Engineering for engineering's sake**\n\nLook, I get it. If you're technical, you want to build things \"the right way.\" But your first version is going to get thrown away anyway.\n\nI've seen founders spend 2 weeks building custom auth when Firebase Auth takes 2 hours. Spend a week on \"perfect database architecture\" when they should be validating if anyone wants the product.\n\nYour MVP doesn't need Redis caching. It doesn't need API versioning. It doesn't need a message queue. Just build the thing and see if anyone uses it.\n\n**4. Desktop-first in 2024**\n\nThis one drives me crazy. \"We'll build desktop first, mobile later.\"\n\nThen they launch and everyone tries it on their phone and it's completely unusable. Buttons too small, forms are a nightmare, loads slow. Users bounce immediately.\n\n70% of traffic is mobile. If you're not mobile-first, you're basically ignoring 70% of potential users.\n\n# What actually works:\n\n**Just launch the damn thing**\n\n6-8 weeks max for an MVP. Not 6 months.\n\nStrip it down to the absolute bare minimum. One core feature that solves one problem. That's it.\n\nLaunch it to 50 people. See if they use it. See if they come back. See if they'll pay.\n\nThen build feature #2. Not before.\n\n**Actually talk to users**\n\nNot \"I'll do user research after I build it.\" Talk to them WHILE you're building.\n\nShow them ugly prototypes. Get feedback every week. Fix the biggest complaint. Show it again.\n\nBy the time you launch publicly, you've already iterated based on real feedback from 50+ conversations.\n\n**Stop trying to make it perfect**\n\nYour v1 is going to suck. That's fine. That's expected.\n\nAirbnb's first site looked like Craigslist. Twitter was just status updates, no images, no replies. Facebook was basic profile pages.\n\nThey all started ugly and iterated based on what users actually wanted.\n\n# Real talk on budgets:\n\nFounders think they need $100k+ to build an app.\n\nFor most MVPs:\n\n* $5k or less: Landing page + mockups + user interviews (validation phase)\n* $20-40k: Actual working MVP with 3 core features (6-8 weeks)\n* $5-10k/month: Iteration based on feedback\n\nYou can get to product-market fit for $30-70k over 6 months. Not $200k over a year.\n\n# Tech stack that actually makes sense:\n\nStop overcomplicating this.\n\nFrontend: React/Next.js  \nBackend: Supabase or Firebase (or just Node + Postgres if you want)  \nHosting: Vercel or Railway ($0-50/month until you have real users)  \nPayments: Stripe\n\nThat's it. This stack can handle 10,000+ users easily. When you get there, THEN optimize.\n\n# When to run away from a dev team:\n\n* They quote you without asking detailed questions about your users/problem\n* They suggest blockchain or microservices for your basic CRUD app\n* They say \"we can build anything for $X\"\n* They promise 6 month timelines for an MVP\n* They don't push back on your feature list\n\nGood teams will challenge your assumptions and try to cut scope, not inflate it.\n\n# The metric that matters:\n\nWeek 1: Do 10+ people actually use it?  \nMonth 1: Do you have 50+ signups and 20+ weekly actives?  \nMonth 3: Has anyone asked when they can pay?\n\nIf you're not hitting these, don't keep building. Either pivot or kill it.\n\nMost founders spend 6 months \"improving\" a product nobody wants. Don't be that person.\n\nAnyway, that's my rant. Happy to answer questions about MVP scoping, tech choices, realistic timelines, whatever.\n\nWe've now helped about 25 startups go from idea to first paying customers. The ones that succeeded all did the things I mentioned above. The ones that failed ignored this advice and built in isolation for 6+ months.",

I wanted something faster, more type-safe, and easier to maintain with a small remote team.\n\nAfter a few weeks of trial and error, here’s what I ended up with (and what I’d actually recommend):\n\n### Core\n- **Next.js** + **tRPC** for type-safe full-stack work\n- **Drizzle ORM** + **PostgreSQL** for transparent SQL and migrations\n- **TanStack Query** to keep data fetching smooth\n\n### Tooling\nI replaced Postman with **Apidog** for API testing and documentation — it’s been surprisingly good, especially the offline support and Postman import.  \nAlso using **Turborepo**, **pnpm**, **Zod**, and **DeveloperHub.io** for monorepos, package management, validation, and docs.\n\n### UI & Infra\n- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** + **Framer Motion** for design\n- **Vercel**, **Redis**, and **Inngest** for deployment, caching, and workflows\n\nHonestly, this setup has made dev life much smoother. I’m still refining things, but it feels clean and fast again.  \n\nCurious, what’s your current SaaS stack looking like for 2025? Any underrated tools you’re using?",

        "selftext": "Thought being the boss meant I'd finally have control over my schedule. Six months in and it's the opposite.\n\n7 hours of meetings yesterday. Then spent hours trying to remember what was decided in each one.\n\nClient calls, team check-ins, vendor negotiations, investor updates. Everything is \"urgent\" and \"quick 15-minute chats\" turn into hour-long requirement sessions.\n\nThe worst part? Keeping track of it all. Who said what, when things are due, which client needs what follow-up. I'm constantly scrambling through scattered notes trying to piece together what was actually agreed upon.\n\nStarted this to build something meaningful. Instead I'm drowning in administrative overhead and playing catch-up on commitments I made in meetings I can barely remember.\n\nHow do you handle the constant information overload without losing your mind?",
