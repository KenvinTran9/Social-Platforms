        "selftext": "Earlier this year I launched a SaaS and around that time I also started building another one.\n\nI'm 40 now and honestly it feels like everything is clicking. All the knowledge from running businesses, having employees (never again btw, hated the HR part), the clients, the failed projects: it all adds up eventually. You get better every time.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody tells you: with age comes responsibility that eats your time.\n\nI have a family now. Two kids, one is 17 months old. For the past 24 months my schedule has been: start at 7:30am when family leaves, work, quick lunch, work, dinner, then build until 1am when kids are sleeping. Weekends too. Oh and we renovated our house and had a newborn in between.\n\nLately I notice my son understands more and more every day. He's watching. And I don't want to be the absent dad behind a laptop.\n\nI love what I'm building. But I'm also exhausted. When this product launches I'm taking a real break. My kids won't be young forever.\n\n**So why am I posting this?**\n\nFor the younger people here: the time is now. You have something I don't anymore: time without tradeoffs. No kids waiting for you. No mortgage. No partner wondering when you'll be done.\n\nLearn. Take chances. Build. Fail. Do it again. You can absorb the hits differently at 25 than at 40.\n\nMake some fun too obviously.

        "selftext": "Every time I see someone post about building a \"passive income SaaS\" I want to ask what exactly they think passive means. Because I've been running a product at $19K MRR for two years and there's nothing passive about it.\n\nMonday this week I spent 3 hours on support tickets. Tuesday was a bug that broke checkout for about 6 hours and cost us roughly $400 in lost sales plus my entire afternoon to fix. Wednesday I wrote a blog post for SEO that took 4 hours. Thursday was calls with two enterprise prospects and updating our roadmap. Friday I dealt with a customer who found a way to abuse our free tier and had to decide whether to grandfather them or cut them off.\n\nThat's a pretty normal week. Sometimes it's lighter. Sometimes it's worse. But the idea that you can build something and then just collect checks while sitting on a beach is a lie people tell to sell courses.\n\nThere's always support. There's always maintenance. There's always marketing that needs doing. There's always the random emergency that appears out of nowhere. The business doesn't run itself. It runs because I run it every single week.\n\nWhat I do have is flexibility. I can work from anywhere. I can structure my days how I want. I can take a week off if I really need to and things won't completely collapse. But that's not passive income. That's self-employment with good boundaries. The distinction matters because if you're getting into SaaS expecting to automate yourself out of a job you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe real pitch for SaaS isn't passive income. It's leverage. It's the ability to serve thousands of customers without thousands of hours. It's income that can grow without proportional increases in time. But it's still work. Always.",

        "selftext": "I run a small digital marketing agency and for the past year I was burning myself out trying to be available 24/7 for clients. Like responding to emails at 11pm, hopping on calls whenever they wanted, basically being their personal support bot.\n\nMy retention was okay, around 65% after 6 months which isnt terrible but not great either. Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",
