        "title": "My SasS hit $2k/mo in 5 months. Here's how I'd do it again from $0",
        "selftext": "So 5 months ago, I was honestly pretty tired of seeing everyone else's success stories while I was still figuring things out. Then I built [my own SaaS called Tydal](https://www.tydal.co/), a marketing tool that helps founders get customers from Reddit.   \nIt's literally just enter your product description -> wait 30 seconds -> dozens of potential customers. It's now pulling in $2k monthly and growing steadily.\n\nSo now I want to share how I'd start over if I had to go back to zero. Here's exactly what I'd do:\n\n**Hunt where the money bleeds**\n\nI'd dig into [r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur/), [r/marketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/), and agency Facebook groups, but here's the twist - I'd sort by controversial not just top. That's where the real pain lives. People arguing about problems means there's emotion, and emotion means willingness to pay.\n\nFor my SaaS, I saw founders constantly complaining about how hard marketing was. One thread had 200+ comments of people talking about horror stories of them wasting months building but not making any many because they couldn't market at all.\n\n**Validate with wallet signals, not surveys**\n\nDon't ask \"would you pay for this.\" I'd look for people already paying for broken solutions. Check what SaaS tools they mention in their complaints. Look at their LinkedIn - are they using expensive enterprise software that's overkill for their problem?\n\nI found businesses paying $200/month for agencies just to track basic leads. That's a clear wallet signal - they're already spending money to solve this pain badly but I could offer a much better and lower cost alternative.\n\n**Build strategically imperfect**\n\nHere's what everyone gets me wrong - they either code for months OR they use no-code tools that create Frankenstein apps that break under real usage.\n\nI'd say ship fast like an MVP (not something that doesn't work) but solves just 1 core feature, then immediately start testing with real users. Not because coding is hard (we've got tons of tools now), but because the real challenge is getting the user experience right for your specific market.\n\nThe difference? No code tools are great for features, but terrible at understanding market positioning and user flows. You need something that can think strategically about the whole product.\n\n**Infiltrate, don't broadcast**\n\nI'd join 5-7 agency Slack communities and Discord servers as well as founder Reddit communities. Not to pitch but to become the person who always has helpful solutions. Answer questions about marketing, share post templates and real examples.\n\nAfter 2-3 weeks of being genuinely helpful, when someone posts \"our marketing has been a disaster,\" I'd DM them directly: \"saw your post about marketing struggles - I built something specifically for this after having the same nightmare. want to see if it helps?\"\n\n**Offer some sort of free try, but don't give everything away**\n\nI'm not saying give all your features for free, but what I would recommend is having a very limited free trial(like limited usage/features) or a credit card required free trial, so the user still has commitment but still gets to try it the product for free. For my first product, I screwed up here, offered everything for free, and got barely any paying users.\n\nIf I started again, I'd have a 7 day free trial but card required. Here's why: most people that won't put even this level of commitment won't become customers anyway. And the psychological effect of payment creates commitment - they'll actually USE your product and give real feedback.\n\nI learned this from watching other founders. The ones who pay become your best beta testers.\n\n**Scale through operator networks**\n\nInstead of broad Facebook ads, I'd target people who are active in specific communities. These people are already looking for solutions and match my ICP. One success story shared in the right Slack channel or posted in the right Reddit community is worth 100 cold outreach messages.\n\nI'd sponsor agency newsletters, but not the big ones everyone knows about. The smaller, niche ones where every reader is a qualified prospect. ROI is insane because there are no wasted impressions.\n\n**The counter-intuitive stuff:**\n\nCompetition validates your market. When I saw 12 other \"marketing\" tools in my niche, I got excited, not worried. It meant founders were already spending money on this problem.\n\nI just knew if I did it 10x better than any of the other competitors I would stand out amongst the pack, the customers are already here.\n\nBuilding in public is overrated for B2B. Big companies and owners don't care about your journey - they care about results. Save the behind-scenes content for after you have paying customers.\n\nIf you're more B2C or have an audience in smaller founders, then building in public may be worth it but it's very commitment heavy.\n\n**If I started tomorrow:**\n\nDay 1: Pick 3 reddit communities(founder heavy) and start contributing value from day 4 i will start scanning for the top 3 pain points from real conversations  \nmax 1 week for building an MVP addressing the biggest pain, then start DM and comment outreach. By day 15, get first paying customer or pivot the positioning\n\nThe key insight: anyone will pay premium prices for tools that solve specific operational problems. Most don't look for cheap they're looking for effective.\n\n**Reality check:**\n\nMost people fail because they're solving imaginary problems or undercharging for real solutions. Saas tools need to either save time, make money, or reduce risk. Everything else is a nice-to-have that won't survive the first budget review.\n\nThe hard part isn't building the app - it's understanding exactly how agencies think about buying software and positioning your solution in those terms.\n\n*If you have any other questions, let me know, I'm happy to help :)*",

        "selftext": "I remember using Quora a lot between 2014 and 2019 – it felt like *the* place for detailed, thoughtful answers. Now I barely see it referenced anywhere. Instead, there are lots of new Q&A / discussion-based startups appearing, and even older platforms like Reddit feel far more active, relevant, and alive.\n\nIt makes me wonder: what really happened to Quora as a product and company? Did the experience slowly get worse (bots, low-quality answers, clickbait, aggressive ads), or did user behavior simply shift toward faster, community-driven platforms and AI tools?\n\nFrom a startup point of view, I’m fascinated by how a small team can compete with – and sometimes beat – a big, established player. With fewer resources but more focus, a startup can ship faster, keep the UX clean, moderate better, and stay closer to what users want *right now*, not what worked 10 years ago.\n\nFor founders and PMs here:\n\n* If you were building in the “Quora space” today, what would you do differently?\n* What do you think Quora got wrong (or stopped doing right)?\n* Are Q&A platforms still a good problem space in 2025, or is that window mostly closed?\n\n(For clarity: I’m not promoting anything, just trying to understand the dynamics and learn from Quora’s trajectory.)",

        "title": "Marketing your SaaS from 0 to 5k MRR: What actually worked after 12 months",
        "selftext": "There are good engineers and founders with super great products but stuck at marketing.\n\nHere is a quick, short list of things you can do to kick off your marketing.\n\nContext: I just hit 5k MRR after 12 months with a developer tools SaaS. Not huge numbers, but enough to share what actually worked versus what I wasted time on.\n\nBefore we start, here are some heads up.\n\na. All I am about to tell is my experience and what worked for me.\n\nb. B2C is easy to scale compared to B2B.\n\nc. Don't try to make anything viral. It's not in your control.\n\nd. Be willing to spend some money on ads.\n\ne. Get ready to be embarrassed and look stupid. It's part of the game.\n\n### Step 1: Setting stage\n\nFind where your audience hangs out. This is very important for B2B products. Ask simple, common questions related to your niche/product to find out where they are. 6/10, you will land back here on Reddit. Check FB, LinkedIn, X, and other forums.\n\nOnce you find out, ask questions, leave comments, and see how engaging the hangout space really is. Don't sell. Remember you are here to test the waters before fishing.\n\nExample:\n\nOn Reddit, I went to r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, and r/indiehackers to see how engaging the community is and ask closely related questions like \"How do you validate your SaaS ideas?\" or \"What tools do you use for market research?\" Remember, don't sell. You are just gathering information.\n\nOn X, get X premium (it increases your reach) and use #buildinpublic and #indiehacker tags. Record a screen recording of how your product works and post it on X. Don't bother asking questions, just show.\n\n### Step 2: Social Proofing is the best way to get initial traction.\n\nGet your co-founder, wife, girlfriend, bf, your cat, or anyone who will back you to comment, upvote, share, or do and get that first 10 upvotes and 3 to 5 comments. People engage with engaged content.\n\nHere is what I did when I wanted to validate my idea on niche subreddits. The first 10 upvotes and a few comments were from me, my friends, and my brother. Then, it quickly gained traction, and people started engaging.\n\nShare a mockup, design, screenshot, or video of your product in action to get some social proof and engagement.\n\nAssess the engagement and traction.\n\nEvaluate the engagement. See how many comments and upvotes you get.\n\nYou will get some good thrashing and downvotes. That's fine.\n\nGo aggressive. Remember that aggression and spamming are neighbours. Share in as many channels as possible (Reddit, X, FB groups, LinkedIn groups, etc.).\n\nIf you do these right, you will have two things:\n\nGeneral impression about your product\n\nWhere people engage the most. This is what we want for the next stage.\n\nIf you fail, it's best to keep looking until you find the right place. (This is especially true if you are B2B.)\n\nFor the next step, you will need to spend some money.\n\n### Step 3: Paid ads.\n\nIf anyone tells you you can't scale using paid ads, they didn't do it right.\n\nShilling out on Google Ads and FB ads is not the way.\n\nSetting up tracking:\n\nWhen I take over an ad account, there is usually no tracking setup. Ads work not because of your product (it helps) but because of your tracking, which sends data to algorithms to find the right audience. If not server side tracking, at least GTM tracking should be in place.\n\nChoosing the right ad platform:\n\nThis is very important. This is where you use the knowledge you gathered in step 1. Choose the platform where your audience is. Find what your competitors are doing, their channels, etc.\n\nCreating ads:\n\nThis is the last important thing. A working ad is an equation. Good product, Good targeting, and good creatives = Good results. It's okay if any of these values are low, but you have to make sure none are 0.\n\nImage ads very rarely work. I have had some really work, but they are the exceptions. What works most of the time is a video ad. Go see some ads and see how they are made. You can check out the ad library to see what your competitors are doing.\n\nPay some influencer to make a video for you.\n\nAd budget:\n\nYou will need to spend at least $1500 in my opinion. Some argue you will need more, some argue less. From my experience, you will need to spend at least $1500 to get a good idea of your ads, audience, and results. Google and Reddit give ad credits. Use it.\n\nClosely monitor your ads. I strongly recommend finding someone who can do this for you, someone who knows what they are doing. Trust me, these channels are designed to make you spend money. This is why many people fail and say paid ads don't work.\n\nSetup tracking:\n\nSetup Hotjar so you can see how people use your product.\n\nSetup GA4 so you can see how people are coming to your site.\n\nBe super proactive and have your product ready.\n\nWhen we launched Reddit ads, we got 200+ signups in a week. I was overwhelmed with support tickets and emails, and I was not prepared for it. The product had some bugs under load, and I had to pause ads and fix things.\n\nRespond to emails and comments. Comments on FB, Reddit ads, X, etc.\n\nNote: while running ads on Reddit, disable comments.\n\n### Step 4: The thing nobody talks about (market research before building)\n\nThis is where I saved the most time and money. Before spending 6 months building features nobody wanted, I spent time actually understanding what problems people had.\n\nI built monitoring systems to track conversations across multiple subreddits. Not just reading posts manually, but actually tracking keywords, pain points, and what solutions people were asking for. This gave me a constant stream of validation data.\n\nFor example, I noticed developers kept complaining about spending weeks on boilerplate code for auth, payments, and database setup. So I prioritized building that into the platform first. That feature alone converted better than anything else.\n\nThe ROI on doing proper market research upfront is insane. You avoid building things nobody wants, and when you do launch, you already know the exact language your customers use to describe their problems.\n\n### Results after 12 months:\n\n5k MRR\n\n85% of users came from Reddit (organic posts and ads)\n\n35% came from X and ProductHunt\n\nAverage customer acquisition cost: $45\n\nChurn rate: 15% monthly (working on this)\n\n### What I would do differently:\n\nStart paid ads earlier. I waited 6 months and wasted time on organic only.\n\nSet up proper tracking from day one. I lost data from my first 100 users.\n\nBuild an email list from week one. I started too late.\n\nSpend more time in communities before launching. I rushed my first posts.\n\n### Tools that helped:\n\nHotjar for user behavior\n\nGA4 for analytics\n\nReddit ads with tight targeting\n\nX premium for reach\n\nThese are the basics. This post is already long. Feel free to ask questions or DM me if you want tailored ideas for your product.\n\nI built [my saas](https://bigideasdb.com) using this exact approach. It helps developers validate ideas faster through Reddit market research and comes with boilerplate code to ship faster.\n\nI hope this helps.",

        "selftext": "I’ve worked with many teams using. Over the years, one thing became very clear: **ERPs don’t fix inventory problems, only strong SOPs do.**\n\nI’ve seen companies implement expensive systems expecting accuracy to magically improve. Instead, the ERP ended up exposing the same issues they already had: inconsistent receiving, undocumented stock movements, incomplete BOMs, and irregular counting routines.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve also seen small teams using modest ERPs achieve excellent accuracy simply because their SOPs were clear, enforced, and part of daily operations.\n\nThe ERP is just a tool. If the underlying process is weak, the system amplifies the chaos. If the process is strong, the ERP becomes a powerful enabler.\n\nSo after many years around these systems, my biggest takeaway is this:  \n**Get the SOPs right first. The technology will only perform as well as the discipline behind it.**",

I’ll be answering emails trying to calm down customers fixing problems I didn’t even create and the whole time I’m wondering if I’m actually building something real or if I’m just dragging myself toward a burnout. I can already see coming  \nand it messes with my head because I WANT this to succeed but being the person who has to handle every bill every mistake every decision every tiny fire that somehow becomes a bigger fire makes me feel like I’m carrying a whole building with one hand and the smallest things tip me over like I’ll sit down for a second to breathe or scroll something on my phone and the stress comes right back like it never left. I’m not saying I’m about to quit but it’s starting to feel way too close and way too normal to think about and I don’t know if that’s just part of running a small business or a sign that I’m pushing myself past the point of being okay.",
