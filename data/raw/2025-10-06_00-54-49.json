I’m doing about $15k-30K/month in business revenue with roughly a 50-70% profit margin depending on the month.\n\nMy wife is a full-time student and works part time, but has seen the earning potential of my business first hand and would like to try her hand at running a business.\n\nPoint blank, she’s a hell of a lot smarter than I am but I’m willing to work 16 hour days, 365 days a year and do quite literally anything necessary to make my business successful. I’ve got two brain cells, a hell of a lot of grit, and healthy risk tolerance.\n\nMy wife is a great employee and straight A student. However, she has trouble starting new things and sticking to them unless there’s social pressure to do so. She’s also risk averse so some of the loans I’ve taken out for my business just about gave her a heart attack.\n\nShe wants me to help fund her business startup costs (which is only a few thousand so nothing I can’t stand to lose), make her a website, create marketing materials, and get leads coming in. I can do all of these things, but I’m worried that by doing so, she won’t learn about marketing or take ownership of the business.\n\nI want to be supportive of her and I’m going to fund the initiative regardless, but do you have any advice on how to navigate this situation so that she feels responsible for the business and takes ownership of it?",

I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct.

        "selftext": "I reconnected with some old friends from elementary school on Facebook during the pandemic. I expected nostalgia and maybe catching up on where life had taken us. Instead, I stumbled into a strange pattern I didn’t see coming.\n\nWith the first couple of friends, we swapped life updates, and when I shared some good news about how things had turned out for me with my small online business, the conversations just… fizzled. They stopped replying, or in some cases blocked me completely. It felt weird because I wasn’t trying to brag, just telling them what I’d been up to.\n\nThat threw me off, so with the next people I found, I downplayed my life situation and kept things simple. Suddenly, the conversations flowed and we stayed in touch. In fact, some of the people who ghosted me originally became cool with me again after I told them I’d “exaggerated” my story the first time around.\n\nIt made me realize how unpredictable people’s reactions can be when you reconnect after years. I thought sharing positive news about business success would be encouraging, but in reality it sometimes made old friends uncomfortable. On the flip side, being more low-key has kept the door open.\n\nI guess the lesson I learned is that not everyone wants to hear about your successes, even if you’re just trying to share your story. Sometimes keeping it simple and focusing on old memories is the better way to reconnect. This kinda reminds me of how some lottery winners have stories of suddenly finding a few of their friends and family members to be resentful of them after winning.\n\n#Edit:\n\nI run a one man web design business where small mom and pop shops and blue collar businesses pay a small fee each month to manage their company websites. I don't see how any of these guys would've thought I was trying to pitch them an MLM when the conversation of what we do for a living came up.",

And lately, that is what is being stripped from real founders.\n\nI have seen this too often.\nA founder pitches to investors, gets rejected, and six months later, the same concept surfaces from a portfolio company, repackaged with funding.\nNon-disclosure agreements are mocked. Validation is dismissed. “Execution” becomes the shield that justifies imitation.\n\nMeanwhile, pseudo-founders parade around with thin-air equity, pseudo-investors hunt safe vanity bets, and pseudo-VCs gamble other people’s money to climb prestige ladders.\n\nIt is not startups versus corporates anymore. It is authentic creation versus systemic mimicry.\n\nThose who actually build from scratch, with sleepless nights, borrowed laptops, and insane conviction, are not just executing. They are imagining.\n\nExecution is a skill.\nVision is a gift.\nBoth are currency. But one is disappearing from circulation.\n\nDo you think ideas are still undervalued, or have founders stopped defending them?",
