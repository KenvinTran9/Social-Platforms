        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

The \"customer\" sent the receipt to a lab for testing.\n\nThere’s a surge in **Prop 65 violation** notices and lawsuits targeting businesses that hand out paper receipts in CA. The trigger: Bisphenol S (BPS) was added to the Prop 65 list in Dec 2024, and even trace amounts in **thermal receipt paper** can now lead to liability.\n\nMany businesses don’t make or sell the paper—and some suppliers even claim it’s “BPS-free”—but plaintiffs are using more sensitive testing to find tiny amounts. There’s no safe harbor level yet, so even minimal BPS can trigger claims. **Penalties can be up to $2,500 per day per violation.**\n\nWhat to consider now:\n\n* Go paperless if you can\n* Switch to phenol-free receipt paper (**BPS and BPA** free) - I believe it has to be both but double check with your supplier.\n* Post a Prop 65 warning where receipts are issued (and on the receipt if possible)\n* If you get a notice, act immediately—there may be a short grace period if you fix it fast\n\nThis is hitting restaurants and retailers hard.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some honest perspective here.\n\nI recently joined a company of 200+ employees as a VP (strategy-focused role). The people are great, the values are strong, culture is good, and overall it feels like there’s a ton of potential.\n\nBut I’ve been kind of shocked by how the executive team actually operates day to day.\n\nMost of the leadership time seems to go into very operational stuff. Weekly meetings are basically project-by-project check-ins, super granular. Monthly meetings are mostly just reporting on last month’s results. Like…this meeting could have been an email kind of vibe. And in the last three months, I honestly haven’t seen a real strategic conversation… like working on the business instead of just in it.\n\nWhat also throws me off is how unprepared a lot of these meetings feel. No agenda, no pre-read, no notes, no follow-up. People show up and kind of wing it. It’s not toxic or anything, the vibe is friendly, but it feels… soft? Like this company could seriously level up if the exec layer was more structured and intentional.\n\nMy issue is: I’m new, and this isn’t technically “my job” to fix right now. I really don’t want to be the guy who walks in and starts criticizing everything or trying to change the culture overnight.\n\nBut at the same time, it feels like such a missed opportunity.\n\nSo I’m torn. Do I bring it up privately with the CEO? Do I just focus on modeling better structure in my own area first? Do I suggest an external consultant to come in and help with exec operating rhythm? Or do I accept that changing leadership culture is a massive uphill battle and not worth spending political capital on this early?\n\nCurious if anyone’s been in a similar situation. Would love any advice on how to approach this without coming off negative or naïve.\n\nThanks ❤️",

        "selftext": "I need to say this because I see this sub is filled with people crying about \"marketing is hard\" while trying to sell a $5 month habit tracker to broke college students XD\n\nI’ve built 30+ MVPs. The ones that have failed? Almost exclusively were B2C \"lifestyle\" apps. The ones making  $20k MRR right now? Boring, ugly B2B tools for unsexy industries.\n\nIf you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, B2C is a trap. You are playing the lottery. You need millions of users to make a living wage. You are competing with TikTok for attention.\n\nStop trying to be the next Zuckerberg. Be the guy who helps a plumbing company organize their invoices.\n\nHere is the \"Value\" part that most devs ignore:\n\n1. The \"Wallet Friction\" Reality\nI built a fitness app for a client once. Getting a consumer to pay $9.99 a month was like pulling teeth. They churned if the UI wasn't perfect.\nThen I built a crappy inventory management tool for a local warehouse. It looked like Windows 95. The owner paid $500 month without blinking. Why? **Because it saved him $2,000 month in lost stock.**\nBusinesses spend money to make money. Consumers spend money to be entertained (and they hate paying for it).\n\n2. You can't out design big tech\nIn B2C, your UI/UX has to be world-class. If your animation stutters, users leave.\nIn B2B, nobody cares. I have a client running a logistics SaaS where the main dashboard is literally a giant HTML table. No React, no Tailwind, just data. His users love it because it loads in 100ms and does the job.\nBoring problems = Lower technical bar = Faster MVP.\n\n3. Marketing is actually easier\nMarketing a consumer app means buying ads and praying for viral tweets.\nMarketing a B2B app? You find 50 plumbing companies on Google Maps and you email them. You can literally call your customers. Try calling your users for your \"AI dating coach.\"\n\nThe Actionable Advice:\nStop looking for ideas on ProductHunt. Go talk to your uncle who runs a roofing business. Go ask your dentist what software they hate.\n\nFind a business that is using Excel to manage a complex process. Build a SaaS that replaces that Excel sheet. Charge $100 month. You only need 80 customers to make six figures.\n\nOr keep building your \"Social Network for Gamers\" and wondering why you have 0 revenue.\n\nBoring pays the bills. \"Cool\" burns the runway.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.",
