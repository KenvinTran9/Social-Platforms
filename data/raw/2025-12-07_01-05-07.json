Customers like buying from the person who built it.\n\nYou can't hand off sales until the playbook is truly systematized. \"Watch me do it\" isn't a playbook.\n\nAt low deal sizes, sales hires are math problems. $60K salary needs $200K+ in new ARR to make sense.\n\nI went back to founder-led sales.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nIn my network, there are quite a few startups that are building their startups solely around marketing funnels instead of products. And the most successful ones are using character-based marketing- creating some pixar-like/animated character and really leaning into that. That reminded me of Duolingo success as well.\n\nI thought why more brands are not using mascots/characters?\n\nSo I participated in a Cursor hackathon a month ago, won $15k 1st place cash prize, quit my job and committed to this idea full-time- and for launch we created this video:\n\n[https://youtu.be/W82pv-sXEHw](https://youtu.be/W82pv-sXEHw) \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and what people think about these kind of videos but since the tool is visual I thought the launch should be visual as well. Also, I got it done super cheaply and thought that this could bring in more impressions for the price than ads could- I might be wrong.\n\nTrends I am building for:  \n  \n1. Character-based marketing has been on an upwards trend, producing incredible results to companies advertising through consumer channels. Duolingo is the prime example.\n\nDistribution is everything nowadays and if mascots mean better ROI on your marketing efforts, then mascots it is! 📈\n\n2. We are betting that more and more AI-first software companies will associate their brands with characters- they all have character built-in, why not associate it with a memorable body? 🤖\n\n3. The amount of online (tech/ecom/digital products) business is growing exponentially. You can one-shot a calorie tracker app or a Shopify ecommerce store with a single prompt, but everyone is using the same tools and models to do so. 🟰\n\nThis means sameness all around- that’s where a well-developed brand character can become your moat.\n\nAnd personally, I am kinda done with this utopian futuristic minimalism.\n\nBut thats me.",

        "selftext": "\nHi team,\n\nI’ve been working on my startup as a side hustle alongside my university educated day job for 10 years now. The R&D has certainly come a long way bootstrapping the whole time. I’ve been scared to take any investment because I knew that I could bootstrap that little bit longer and as a result give away less equity the further along I got it. But it’s come at a cost I didn’t think about 10 years ago, I’ve swapped gained equity for life time. \n\nI feel so behind compared to my friends and family members of similar age who are all marked with children. I had a relationship for 8 years of the startup’s life and 2 years ago it all got too much and we separated. She wanted to move forward and I just couldn’t commit to having kids before the R&D was earning revenue. When I first started the startup at 24 I thought ‘I’ll be a millionaire in a few years’. It’s not about the money specifically, it’s about the financial security of being able to do something I love rather than the day job that I don’t love. But here we are now I’m 36 and single and I feel ashamed going on dates and admitting that I don’t have a house or a nice car (which would normally be associated with my day job). I’ve attached the idea of success in the startup to my def worth as a person. Deep down I think I’ve had the belief that I need the startup to succeed in order to be loveable - even to those that admit they love me because I was/am under the illusion I need to be successful before anyone could see me and was/am too ashamed at my position relative to where I thought I would be. \n\nI should add: the startup is in the biology and material science field. It takes a long time to grow things but the IP developed along the way compounds, it’s a little different to a software startup. \n\nTL;DR: The R&D is certainly close to investment level and I can’t stop, I just feel behind, embarrassed and ashamed at where I am compared to where I thought I would be at this point in life. I’m sure so many of you can relate - I’d love to hear your experiences to just help me realise I’m not a loser or alone and that it’s all going to be ok. For anyone else who needs to hear this: you’re not alone, I’m right hear with you and I hope it’ll all work out for us. \n\nMy takeaway/what I've learnt: James Dyson has been a major role model for me. I've always wanted to operate like him and be successful without external funding but we're not all James Dyson and have a product as revolutionary as that. I am learning to accept that 100% of 0 is still 0. It's better to own part of a million/billion dollar company than to own all of a worthless company. Time to ask for help.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
