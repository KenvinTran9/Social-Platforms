        "title": "Everyone's trying to get rich with tiny saas wrappers. The real opportunity is boring RAG.",
        "selftext": "I've been building RAG systems for a year. Made about $50k from three companies.\n\nEveryone on Twitter and Reddit thinks they're going to get rich building a $29/mo saas wrapper. It's a lottery ticket. The real money is in the most boring, obvious problem: companies can't find shit in their own documents.\n\n**What I actually built**\n\nThis wasn't just slapping tools together. It's a production pipeline.\n\n**Ingestion:** Docs are corrupt, APIs fail. I used Temporal to manage the workflow; it handles retries so I don't have to.\n\n**Processing:** Fixed size chunking is garbage. It cuts sentences in half. I used zchunk (ZeroEntropy) to split docs semantically.\n\n**Indexing:** I indexed everything twice in Qdrant. First with zembed-1 (dense, for semantic meaning). Second with FastEmbed SPLADE (sparse, for keywords and acronyms like 'ISO-9001' that dense vectors miss). You need both.\n\n**Retrieval:** This is where demos fail. A query comes in. I hit both indexes, get a wide net of results (top 50). It's a messy list.\n\n**Reranking:** I feed that messy list + query into zerank-1 (ZeroEntropy). This is the most critical step. It re-sorts everything for actual relevance. This one step fixed \\~30% of my bad results.\n\n**Generation:** Only then do I take the new top 3-5 results and feed them to Gemini 2.5 Pro to write the answer with sources.\n\nThe value wasn't the LLM. It was the plumbing. Backend is FastAPI, frontend Next.js. Postgres just runs Temporal.\n\n**How I got clients**\n\nTo be honest, mine came mostly through personal connections. A friend in compliance was drowning in PDFs, I built them something for $8k, and it spread from there to a research company ($19k) and a logistics firm ($23k).\n\nBut the market is so huge, I'm sure you know someone in one of those industries I listed. Just dig. And if you really don't, just find the right person and email them directly. Forget Upwork. Or I am even sure that in this sub you're all better marketers than me. \n\n**The actual opportunity**\n\nEvery mid-size company has 10+ years of documents in SharePoint or network drives. Their search doesn't work. They are paying people high salaries to manually dig through files. You fix that, they pay $20k, $30k, $50k. Per project. It's a real business, not a side project.\n\n**Industries that actually pay**\n\n* Pharma (regulatory docs)\n* Manufacturing (specs, manuals)\n* Law firms (contracts, cases)\n* Logistics (supplier docs)\n* Energy (inspection reports)\n\nBasically anywhere people waste hours in PDFs.\n\n**How you can do the same**\n\nYou don't even need to be that technical. Go make a professional looking site. Pick one of those industries. Anywhere you have connections or understand the space a minimu,. Contact teams. Ask them how they find internal info. Show them the problem and how much time they're wasting. When they say yes, find a freelance developer  hand them this exact pipeline. You pay them $5k, you charge $30k. You manage the client, they build. Do that 3-4 times a month and you have a legit million dollar a year business. \n\n**Reality check**\n\nThis isn't sexy. You won't get hyped on Twitter for it. But companies will pay $20k+ for something that actually functions vs. another \"AI transformation initiative\" that goes nowhere. The stack is figured out. The sales cycle is short if you can demo a working system. Everyone is fighting for $29/mo subscribers on their tiny saas wrappers, while enterprises are sitting there with $50k checks ready for anyone who can solve this one, boring, high value problem. ",

        "selftext": "I run a small alterations shop in Austin and honestly I dont know why I waited this long to do this. For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it. Track your numbers first so you know what youre actually dealing with but dont wait as long as I did.",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",
