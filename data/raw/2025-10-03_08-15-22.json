        "selftext": "So my mate opened what was supposed to be a bakery about 8 months ago. Decent pastries, cakes and stuff, nothing special and just about breaking even.\n\nThen she pivoted hard into the \"coffee shop\" vibe and renamed it something pretentious with \"& Co.\" at the end. She's charging £3.80 for a flat white and £4.20 for a cappuccino. Premium prices for the area.\n\nThe coffee is made with a Nespresso Vertuo Pop she got for £99 from Argos and pods that cost about 38p each when bought in bulk. No barista skills needed, just stick in a pod and press a button. She's making £3+ profit per cup after the pod cost.\n\nThe irony is she first saw this machine when she came to my house. I've had this machine for yonks and I know that if you stick with the safe options like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Mexico and those kind of pods, you just can't go wrong and nobody gonna have a clue.\n\nThere's a proper £2k+ commercial espresso machine in the corner, the kind you'd expect in a specialty coffee shop. Customers can barely see it unless they're really looking or go out of their way to look behind the counter.\n\nShe bought it broken on purpose. Found it on Facebook Marketplace for dirt cheap and it's purely for aesthetics. It's never worked, it's literally just a prop.\n\nBehind that machine is the Nespresso machine doing all the actual work.\n\nFrom what she's told me she's selling 170+ cups a day on average. Rough maths says that's £500+ in daily coffee revenue alone (not counting pastries) which is approx \\~£15k a month just from coffee.\n\nThe customers seem to be raving about it on Google reviews.\n\nPart of me thinks this is genius cos she's created an environment people want to be in and they're happy to pay premium prices. She laughs it off saying \"restaurants mark up wine 300%, nobody bats an eye\".\n\nIs this just smart business? She's asking me to join her and double down.",

If anything, I hope our story shows that *anyone* can figure it out and make it happen if they stick with it long enough.\n\nI thought about writing a long post with bullet points on all the lessons learned, and I can do that if people want, but this post was to spread encouragement that anyone can do this. I’ve been contributing to this subreddit for 10 years, and I’ve learned a ton from the experienced founders here (especially when I was starting out).\n\nFor anyone who says there aren’t real success stories here, that it’s all “wantrepreneurs”, remember: everyone has to start somewhere. A lot of us are here, lurking, learning, contributing, and quietly grinding away on our projects until one day the pieces finally click.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* Thank you all for the kind words.

        "selftext": "A few months ago, I had an idea I couldn’t shake. The problem was familiar: every time I’ve had an idea in the past, I either got stuck in analysis paralysis or went down the rabbit hole of coding, logos, product names, and all the “fun” distractions. Weeks or months would pass before I showed it to anyone, and by then I usually lost steam or realised nobody wanted it.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to do the opposite. My goal was simple: could I get strangers to care about my idea in less than a weekend? No product, no backend, no fancy branding. Just the bare minimum to test the interest.\n\nSo I worked on creating a landing page. To get people onto the page, I did two things. First, I shared it in a couple of communities where I knew the target audience hang out. Second, I put about $250 into very small ads just to see if anyone outside my personal network would click through. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe results surprised me. In 4 days, about 220 people visited the page. 63 of them actually signed up. That’s almost 30%. And a few of those people even replied to the confirmation email I sent, asking me questions about the idea and saying they’d pay for something like this if it existed. That was the kind of signal I never got from building in a vacuum.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But it gave me more validation in two days than months of building ever had. And honestly, it took the pressure off. Instead of wondering “does anyone want this?” I could move forward knowing at least a small group of people had raised their hands.\n\nSo if you’re sitting on an idea and spinning your wheels, don’t overthink it. Write down the problem clearly, describe how you’d solve it, and put up a simple landing page with a signup form. Drive a little traffic and watch what happens. Even if you only get a handful of signups, that’s still real feedback from real people.",

She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",
