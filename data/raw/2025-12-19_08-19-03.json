Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post.

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half.

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

        "selftext": "Spent the last 8 months going deep into SEO while building a tool to automate it for my own projects. Analyzed over 1,000 SaaS websites, tested different tactics, tracked everything. Here's what I learned.\n\n**-> 26.8% of websites can't even be found by Google**\n\nOver 1/4 of the websites I analyzed had critical crawlability issues. The content exists, but search engines can't discover it.\n\nMost common problems:\n\n* No sitemap or broken sitemap\n* JavaScript redirections instead of actual `<a href=\"\">` links (React devs, this one's for you)\n* `robots.txt` blocking crawlers by accident\n* Orphaned pages with zero internal links\n\nTakes 10 minutes to audit. Can save you months of wondering why nothing's indexing.\n\n**Some basics people ignore:**\n\n* Keep everything within 3 clicks from your homepage\n* Fix orphan pages immediately (pages with zero internal links = invisible)\n* Category pages should be 800+ words of actual content, not just link lists\n\nBut here is what really made the difference:\n\n**First: consistency.** \n\nOne article per day beats 10 articles in one week then nothing. SEO is slow, but it's the highest ROI channel once it kicks in. So I automated the entire content pipeline: keyword research, writing, internal linking, publishing. I built [BlogSEO](https://blogseo.io) for this, and once I connect it to a webiste, I don't touch it anymore.\n\n**Second: backlinks.** \n\nThis was the annoying part. Content I could automate, but backlinks still meant cold outreach and begging for guest posts.\n\nSo I built a network where websites doing the same thing can exchange backlinks automatically. The system matches sites by niche, then does ABC triangle exchanges so it looks natural. 120 websites in the network now and growing daily. Everyone's sites linking to each other without anyone manually doing anything.\n\n**Third: AI SEO**\n\nThis matters even more now that ChatGPT and Perplexity are becoming real acquisition channels. The more quality content you have out there with backlinks pointing to it, the more likely you get cited. Seen businesses go from zero AI traffic to 60-70 leads/month in 2-3 months just by publishing consistently.
