I’m doing about $15k-30K/month in business revenue with roughly a 50-70% profit margin depending on the month.\n\nMy wife is a full-time student and works part time, but has seen the earning potential of my business first hand and would like to try her hand at running a business.\n\nPoint blank, she’s a hell of a lot smarter than I am but I’m willing to work 16 hour days, 365 days a year and do quite literally anything necessary to make my business successful. I’ve got two brain cells, a hell of a lot of grit, and healthy risk tolerance.\n\nMy wife is a great employee and straight A student. However, she has trouble starting new things and sticking to them unless there’s social pressure to do so. She’s also risk averse so some of the loans I’ve taken out for my business just about gave her a heart attack.\n\nShe wants me to help fund her business startup costs (which is only a few thousand so nothing I can’t stand to lose), make her a website, create marketing materials, and get leads coming in. I can do all of these things, but I’m worried that by doing so, she won’t learn about marketing or take ownership of the business.\n\nI want to be supportive of her and I’m going to fund the initiative regardless, but do you have any advice on how to navigate this situation so that she feels responsible for the business and takes ownership of it?",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "selftext": "**Has anyone else gone through something like this with American Express?**  If so, I would love to know **how to deal with this issue**, I will be contacting them tomorrow (Monday) morning. If you have dealt with it, how did you resolve it?\n\nI’ve been with Amex for over 25 years. Between my business and personal cards, I’ve probably run somewhere between $30–50 million through them over that time. Never missed a payment. **Never had a problem. I have paid early EVERY month** on my Plum card to receive the cash back. My personal credit score is over 800.  My business has been more profitable every year it has been in existence.  There should be zero flags to show a problem.\n\nThen out of nowhere, this past Saturday evening around 6:45 PM, I get an email saying my available credit limits have been reduced on all six of my cards. I thought it had to be spam. Logged in and it was real. Every single card had its limit cut dramatically, some by as much as 90%.\n\nThat instantly made several cards show as “over limit” by tens of thousands of dollars, even though I hadn’t made a new charge. Just because Amex decided to lower the limit after the balance was already there.  No warning, no explanation. Just an email after hours on a weekend.\n\nNow I have personal cards showing a balance greater than the credit limit, which will negatively impact my credit score if the credit bureau happens to pull the data today.\n\nSo I called the number on the back of the card and got sent to a recording saying underwriting was closed until Monday morning. There was no way to get past that prompt once I put my card info in.  They sent the email ten minutes after they closed, so there was literally no way to talk to anyone. Perfect timing, right?\n\nNow imagine if I were traveling internationally or needed those cards to cover scheduled payments. Too bad. They just stop working. Some of mine already declined Sunday morning for pending charges, and of course Amex won’t be covering any fees or fallout from that.\n\nI tried the chat on their site, spent 15 minutes explaining everything, only to be told I needed to call a “special number” where someone could help me as a “long time valued customer.” I called it, and got the same voicemail saying to try again Monday.  Valued customer...right.\n\nSo here I am, 25 years of loyalty, perfect history, and six suddenly crippled accounts that I can’t even use because someone at Amex flipped a switch and didn’t think about what that does to small business owners who rely on those cards every day.\n\nIf this can happen to me, it can happen to any of you. And it raises real questions about how Amex handles risk, or maybe just their cash exposure, without giving long-time customers any warning or chance to prepare.\n\nFor small business owners, this is something to think about before making Amex your main line of credit. Because “member since 1998” apparently doesn’t mean much when their algorithm or someone working risk on a weekend decides to cut you off on a Saturday night.",

        "selftext": "So I work for a startup and the CEO showed me our monthly expenses and i literally cannot comprehend what i'm looking at. Our payroll software alone costs $8,900/month. For comparison, AWS ($3,800) + Stripe fees ($2,800) + our entire remaining tech stack is about the same. we're literally paying as much for payroll as we pay to run our entire product\n\nWe're a 31 person SaaS company (22 US, 9 international). The company has been using one of the \"big\" payroll providers for 2 years. thought this was just what it costs until i saw the breakdown:\n\n-base US payroll (22 people): $480\n\n-\"international contractor management\" (9 people): $5,400\n\n-\"compliance monitoring\": $1,100\n\n-\"tax filing services\": $780\n\n-\"enhanced reporting\": $420\n\n-random monthly fees: $720\n\nthat's $600 per INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTOR per month. how is sending money abroad more expensive than running our whole infrastructure??\n\nBest part: our romanian dev didn't get paid for 8 days last month because of \"verification issues\" while we're paying them 2x what we pay for AWS which handles 2 million API calls daily\n\nhow did we let payroll become this expensive?? anyone else audit their costs and realize payroll is just bleeding money? Why nobody builds something cheaper?",
