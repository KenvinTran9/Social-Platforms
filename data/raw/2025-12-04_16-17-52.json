        "selftext": "Last week I'm covering for our bookkeeper who's out on maternity leave and I'm going through expense reports from the last few months. I notice that one employee submitted the exact same Uber receipt twice (same ride and same amount 38 bucks) once in February and again in April. at first I figured it was just a mistake like maybe they just accidentally uploaded the same photo twice or something\n\nI then started actually looking at their other submissions and that's when I was able to figure it out. Personal grocery runs labeled as 'office supplies' dinner with their friends labeled as 'client meeting' and I'm pretty sure some of the receipt screenshots were edited because the fonts looked off and dates didn't line up with the transaction amounts\n\nI went back through about 6 months of their reports and conservatively they probably stole around $2500 (2544 bucks to be exact) from us. When I confronted them they got immediately defensive and tried to say it was \"unclear what counted as a business expense\" and then quit on the spot. Yes they quit on the spot  \n  \nYesterday I got paranoid cuz I started thinking of all the people that could have been doing this too and I just never noticed because I've never dealt with expenses  \nI don't want to become some paranoid micromanager who audits every coffee purchase but I also clearly can't just operate on the honor system anymore. I feel like I need some kind of actual system but I also don't know what's reasonable for a company our size (19 people and maybe 25 on January)",

        "selftext": " We’ve been successfully growing our SaaS using our own method: \"High Agency\" Founder-Led Growth (using AI to build relationships and find leads). It works, and the leads are high quality.\n\nBut as a founder, I had to ask: Are we doing it the hard way? Could we just throw money at the problem and get faster results?\n\n\n\nSo, we decided to run an A/B Test:\n\n\\- Option A (The \"Easy\" Way): Pay big influencers to blast our product to 640k+ people.\n\n\\- Option B (The \"Holaboss\" Way): Stick to our AI agent that builds personal influence and finds high-intent leads one by one.\n\nI put $750 into Option A to see if it could beat our internal benchmarks. Here is exactly what happened.\n\n\n\n**Step 1: The Setup (Giving Option A a fair fight)**\n\nWe didn't want to set this up to fail. We targeted the AI/Tech niche on Twitter, our exact demographic. We even wrote the threads ourselves to ensure the messaging was perfect.\n\nWe picked three influencers:\n\n\\- Influencer A: 77.4k followers - Cost: $150\n\n\\- Influencer B: 153.8k followers - Cost: $250\n\n\\- Influencer C: 408.9k followers - Cost: $350\n\nTotal Reach: \\~640,000 followers. Total Spend: $750.\n\n\n\n   **Step 2: The Expectation vs. Reality**\n\nThe posts went live. The vanity metrics exploded. Huge views. Massive likes and retweets. Visually, it looked like a viral launch. We expected hundreds of signups to pour in.\n\n\n\n   **Step 3: The Results (The Brutal Truth)**\n\nHere is the cold shower. Those 640,000 \"followers\" generated:\n\n\\- **103 Unique Visitors.**\n\n\\- **60 Total Signups.**\n\nThat’s a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $12.50 per free signup. For a bootstrapped team, this is a disaster.\n\nThe engagement was likely from \"pods\" (engagement groups). They hype each other up, but they don't click, they don't read, and they definitely don't buy.\n\n\n\n**Step 4: The Conclusion (Founder-Led Growth Win)**\n\nThis experiment was an expensive way to validate what we already suspected: **You cannot \"rent\" trust.**\n\nWhile we burned $750 for 60 low-intent signups via influencers, our own tool (Holaboss) continued to run in the background. It was generating steady, high-intent leads by actually engaging with people and solving problems, for a fraction of the cost and zero \"fake\" hype.\n\n\n\nHere is the [proof of this campaign](https://www.notion.so/Proof-of-influencer-campaign-2bd506c7667d80f2a4dbfaab3c066e82?source=copy_link)\n\n\n\n**The Lesson for Indie Hackers**\n\nIf you are thinking of taking the influencer shortcut, here is my advice (learned the hard way):\n\n1. Negotiate hard. Prices are made up. Push for 2-3x lower.\n\n2. Avoid fake influencers. High follower counts often mean nothing but bot farms/pods.\n\n3. The \"Link in Bio\" trap. Ensure they reply to every comment with your link.\n\n4. Pay after posting. Never upfront.\n\nFor us? We are done with \"rented\" audiences. We are sticking to building real influence on our own AI.\n\nHas anyone else successfully A/B tested Influencers vs. Organic/Founder-led growth? I’d love to know if I just got unlucky, or if this is the standard now.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in Founder-led growth, try: [Holaboss.ai](http://www.holaboss.ai/)",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I am trying to get started with freelance web design for small businesses. I knew of a local restaurant owner from my community that had no website at all so I decided to meet with them and talk about making a website for them. They didn't ask for one but once I brought the idea to them, they liked the sound of it and wanted me to create it for them. \n\nI worked on it for a while on Square and integrated it with their online ordering system and POS system in their restaurant. I even added a catering and reservation section that they didn't have before. I briefly brought up the pay and they said they'd \"put me on a payroll\" and that was it. So once I finished making the website for them, they started having customers use it already. So I asked him about being paid for my work through text messages and he just read the message without saying anything. Then I asked him again if we can have a call to talk about it, and he left me on read again. \n\nSo I decided to turn off the website to not be public anymore, and he still hasn't reached out or anything. I really wanted to help him build a website for his business, but was kinda surprised he didn't appreciate my help and offer to pay anything. What should I do? Should I reach out to him again asking for a specific amount of money for the website so I can make it public again? Should I go to his restaurant in person and ask to speak with him? Not really sure what my next move should be. ",
