        "selftext": "I run a small alterations shop in Austin and honestly I dont know why I waited this long to do this. For three years I kept walk in hours because I thought thats what customers wanted and I was terrified of losing business.\n\nThe reality was way different tho. Id have people walk in right when Im in the middle of a hem on a wedding dress, or Id block out time to finish rush orders and then spend 45 minutes with someone who just wanted to ask if I could fix their jacket zipper (which I dont even do). My actual turnaround times were getting worse because I couldnt focus.\n\nI spent like two months researching what other alterations places were doing, talked to my regular customers, even checked polymarket to see what the recession odds were since I was worried people would stop spending on alterations if the economy tanked. But mostly I just tracked my own numbers for a month and realized that 60% of walk ins either didnt book anything or wanted services I dont offer.\n\nMade the switch to appointment only in September. Put up signs, updated my google business, sent emails to my regular clients. First week I was stressed as hell thinking my phone would stop ringing.\n\nOpposite happened. My schedule is actually FULLER now because people book in advance and I can plan my day properly. Im finishing work faster, taking on more jobs, and honestly my stress levels dropped like crazy. Plus the clients who book appointments tend to be more serious and respectful of my time.\n\nOnly downside is I do get the occasional person who shows up anyway and gets annoyed when I cant help them right then. But honestly thats on them for not reading the giant sign on my door lol\n\nIf youre on the fence about this just do it. Track your numbers first so you know what youre actually dealing with but dont wait as long as I did.",

I didnâ€™t have a plan just curiosity and a few late nights spent looking into multiple listings.  \n  \nI began to notice patterns. Certain categories like electronics and collectibles sold quicker and had better margins. I started tracking what sold best, improving my listing descriptions , and focusing more on things like PC laptops, video cards, and even menâ€™s shoes.  \n  \nOnce I found what was working the income became steady. It now brings in around $3k a month which still amazes me considering how it all started. But everybody has to start somewhere I guerss.  \n  \nStill learning as I go but thought Id share it here to inspire others. For those who tried it which products or niches did better for yo??",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",
