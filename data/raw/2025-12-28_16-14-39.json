I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
