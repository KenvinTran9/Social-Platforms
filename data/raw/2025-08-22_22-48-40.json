        "selftext": "Our senior DevOps engineer thought I'd lost my mind. He didn't join a startup to do sales. So he promised me 5 calls and I guaranteed he'd never have to do it again. It was a bit of a back-and-forth but I strongly believe it fundamentally changed how we build products.\n\nWhen I sat in on the calls, I observed a few things: \n\n\\- Seeing them explain why our competitor's platform was \"too complex for non-technical users.\"  \n\n\\- Seeing them assure the customer that the continuous monitoring was actually working (We had beautiful logs and metrics. But what they wanted was a green checkmark.)\n\n\\- Seeing them respond when customers asked \"Can someone just do this for me?\" \n\nMost of our team are backend engineers too and I think this fundamentally made them better product designers. At the end of it, they were sketching a completely different architecture without my \"PMing\". Because they finally understood who was actually using our product.\n\nThe rewrite took 2 weeks. We removed 60% of features. Added a simple progress bar. Built Slack integration for questions. Created \"done-for-you\" workflows. \n\nOur support tickets dropped 70%. \n\nThe biggest problem with most engineers is actually over-engineering. \n\n1. **Users don't care about your elegant solution** \\- they care about their problem going away\n2. **Technical correctness < user understanding** \\- if they can't use it, it doesn't matter how well it's built\n3. **Every feature has a cost** \\- not in code, but in user confusion\n\nSince this experience, I've made this a mandatory culture in our team. Every engineer takes 5 sales calls per quarter. There's always going to be a little pushback. But hearing the exhaustion in a customer's voice when they say \"I just need this to work.\" does it all. I think it helps build up their instinct. ",

        "selftext": "In 2014 I launched a Shopify store in an adult niche (cannabis accessories). Everyone told me I was insane. \"Illegal\", \"will never work\", \"you cant advertise\". But I saw where the legalization trend was going and pushed forward anyway.\n\nBy 2016 we were doing $6M a year in revenue. 25,000 square foot warehouse, thousands of SKUs, private label containers arriving monthly, 60 full-time staff, free lunch, cold brew on tap, all that fun stuff. 99% of our traffic came from Google Search, because at the time cannabis accessories were banned from every major ad platform. We ranked #1 for bongs, vaporizers, glass pipes, and pretty much every other high-intent keyword.\n\nThen November 16, 2016 happened, one week before Black Friday. I woke up to $150 in sales instead of the $6,000 we’d normally have by mid-morning. Panic mode set in. The site was live, checkout worked, payment processor was fine. Then I checked Google Analytics and saw a 99% drop in traffic overnight.\n\nSearch Console revealed the problem: manual penalty for link manipulation. The thing is, we had never bought backlinks. Someone had bought hundreds of thousands of spammy backlinks to our site in a targeted SEO attack, and it worked.\n\nThe next month was brutal. We laid off more than 50 employees. I was personally on the hook for a $25k a month lease (with a $60k salary because we were reinvesting EVERYTHING), and holding $1M in inventory with no way to move it.\n\nThen came the pivot. We had the warehouse and the inventory, so I put together a quick landing page offering dropshipping to our competitors at 50% off retail. Word spread fast. Within a year we were the main dropship supplier for the industry. I built custom software to handle the scale, keep inventory in sync, and manage fulfillment automatically.\n\nSix months later the manual penalty was lifted and our SEO traffic started to come back, but I wasn’t about to give up the dropship revenue stream.\n\nIn 2021 a retail giant, High Tide Inc, approached to buy our store. They didn’t want the software, so I spun it out into a new company, named it Crowdship.io, and marketed it as a \"dropship automation software\". Since then we’ve done over $50M in GMV, became the largest B2B dropship platform for cannabis accessories, and built a whole new business out of what started as a complete disaster.\n\nSometimes the thing that nearly kills your business is the same thing that ends up saving it. When life blows up your plans, look for the pivot hiding in the wreckage. Don't let anything keep you down. ",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** I tried to grow on X by being a reply guy, got flagged as “AI” and blocked by a big account, then rebuilt my process to sound human, be useful, and compound attention. This is the exact system I use now. No hype. No pitch. Steal it.\n\n(Read time \\~ 8 minutes)\n\n# Context and the punch in the face\n\nI am launching multiple projects this year. One shipped fast, but a social style product needs distribution. X turned out to be the best place to find users and get feedback.\n\nI went all in on replies. It worked at first. Then a top creator publicly blocked me because a tool rated my reply “likely AI.” That stung. It also forced me to fix my voice and my process. I kept what worked and killed what felt fake.\n\n# What actually moves the needle on X\n\n* **Replies beat original posts at the start.** Early replies under big accounts put you in front of more people, faster.\n* **Volume matters, but quality controls survival.** 20 to 30 replies per day is fine. Weak replies get you muted.\n* **You need a spine of original posts.** Aim for 3 to 5 of your own tweets daily. Talk about what you are building, problems you are solving, and small wins.\n* **Speed to comment is leverage.** Sort by Latest in the right communities and reply fast while the first wave of attention is still hot.\n* **Pick your pond.** Build in public, indie makers, SaaS founders, startup. Start there, then branch out to your niche.\n\n# The daily system I use now\n\n**Time budget: 60 to 90 minutes.**\n\n1. **Warm up, 10 minutes** Skim your lists. Like a few posts. Leave one short reply that adds something obvious but useful. Get typing rhythm.\n2. **Reply block, 30 to 45 minutes**\n\n* Open the right communities. Sort by Latest.\n* Hit fresh posts from accounts with reach or momentum.\n* Leave 15 to 20 replies. Short. Specific. Helpful.\n* Goal per reply: teach one thing or remove one doubt.\n\n1. **Your own posts, 10 to 15 minutes** Schedule 3 for the day. One progress update, one tiny lesson, one question that invites answers.\n2. **Follow up, 10 to 15 minutes** Answer people who answered you. This is where followers convert. Treat replies like DMs in public.\n\n# How to write replies that do not get flagged as AI\n\nThese rules came from painful trial and error.\n\n* **Write how you talk.** Short sentences. Everyday words.\n* **Cut fluff words.** Unlock, empower, supercharge, elevate. Delete.\n* **Be specific.** Replace “great advice” with “this line about shipping ugly v1 is gold.”\n* **No em dashes.** Periods and commas only.\n* **Do not mirror the tweet too closely.** Mention one detail, then add new info.\n* **If it is a simple question, answer with one line.** Respect time, yours and theirs.\n* **Admit doubt.** “Not sure about X, but Y worked for me with 3k users.”\n* **One emoji max.** Use it like salt, not soup.\n\n# My personal guardrails that improved results\n\nI literally taped these above my screen.\n\n* If I do not know, I do not pretend.\n* No hashtags in replies.\n* No dashes. No fancy synonyms.\n* Do not try to sound smart. Sound useful.\n* Do not overquote the original tweet. Add value and move on.\n* Make small, human grammar. One short imperfection can help you feel real.\n* When in doubt, say less.\n\n# Templates you can paste and adapt\n\nUse these as starting points, then add one specific detail from the original tweet.\n\n* **Micro-win:** “Did this last week. Result was X. Two tips that saved me time. A) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. B) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”\n* **Pushback with care:** “Counterpoint. Tried \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ with 1k users. It backfired because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. What fixed it was \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”\n* **Resource without spam:** “Quick pointer. Search for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. The first two results are solid. Helped me cut setup from 2 hours to 20 minutes.”\n* **Connect dots:** “This pairs well with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. If you stack them, you get \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Not perfect, but it got me from A to B.”\n* **Clarify request:** “Do you want examples for B2B or consumer? The playbook is different. Happy to share 3 from whichever you need.”\n* **Cheer with substance:** “Love this. One thing to watch when you scale to 10k users is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Caught me off guard.”\n\n# 7 day ramp that builds momentum\n\n**Day 1** Define your three content pillars. Example. Build in public, distribution lessons, tiny tech tips.  \n**Day 2** Build a private list of 50 accounts in your niche. Use it daily.  \n**Day 3** Write 10 reply templates like the ones above. Keep them short.  \n**Day 4** Ship 3 of your own posts and 20 replies. Track which replies get any engagement at all.  \n**Day 5** Double down on what got replies. Kill what got ignored.  \n**Day 6** Post one small thread that teaches one thing you did this week. 5 to 7 lines. No fluff.  \n**Day 7** Audit. Which topics pulled real conversations. Keep those. Cut the rest.\n\nRepeat weekly. The compounding is real.\n\n# Metrics I track and why\n\n* **Replies per day** simple output target.\n* **Reply hit rate** replies that get any engagement divided by total replies. Aim to raise this from 10 percent to 25 percent.\n* **Profile visits per day** tells you if your replies send people home.\n* **Follows per 100 profile visits** sanity check for your bio and pinned post.\n* **Original posts that sparked comments** tells you what to post more of.\n* **Time to first reply on big posts** lower is better.\n\n# What got me blocked and how I fixed it\n\nI leaned on AI writing too hard. The wording was clean and empty. A tool flagged it. A creator blocked me. That sucked. I rebuilt my approach.\n\n* I added a tiny personal input to every reply. One lived experience or number.\n* I wrote a few rules that force my voice. No corporate words, no showy grammar, no dashes, no hashtags, no puff.\n* I built a crude scorer to shame my own replies before posting. You do not need a tool. Read your reply out loud. If it would sound weird in a bar, rewrite.\n\n# Common pitfalls to avoid\n\n* Replying to everything. Spray and pray gets you muted.\n* Echoing the tweet with new words. Adds nothing.\n* Selling in replies. It burns trust.\n* Debating for sport. You are not in school. You are building a business.\n* Quoting big accounts with zero context. Dead on arrival.\n\n# Monetization reality check\n\nAt around 10k followers, one focused hour per day can bring meaningful income from ads or small offers. Not millions. Enough to matter. Focus on serving a specific crowd and the rest follows.\n\n# Final notes\n\nI did build a small Chrome extension for myself to speed up replies with personal inputs but you do not need it to win but it will save you time and save you when you are out of ideas. But more than my extension, you need a system, a voice, and consistency.",

        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My name’s Rob & I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts.\n\nA couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day.\n\nI started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently.\n\nFirst off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS \"guru\" preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different.\n\n**My secrets to a successful launch day:**\n\n**Building in “Stealth”:** I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready.\n\n* Posted screenshots asking \"who wants to try this?\" - no product links\n* DMed interested people to join private beta\n* Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building\n* Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better\n* Built hype so launch day went that much better\n\n**Launch Day Momentum:** When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD.\n\n* Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials → 50,000 views\n* Screenshot PostHog analytics → 20,000 views\n* Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard → 10,000 views\n* Every win becomes content that drives more wins\n\n**Why Photos Matter:** Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples’ attention.\n\n* People root for underdogs (probably you)\n* Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era)\n\n**The Numbers Game:**\n\n* 70 free trials in 24 hours\n* 50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%)\n* 200,000+ views on X in 24hrs\n* 95% of traffic from organic X posts\n\nOver 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, I’m at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending.\n\nAsk me anything about:\n\n* Failing 5 times and what I learned\n* Building in \"stealth\" while still posting publicly\n* Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta\n* Launch day execution\n* Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else\n\nGoal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible.\n\nHappy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :)\n\nLet's gooo!\n\n(I'll be sticking around most of the day to answer questions. And I'll try my best to answer any asked even after today, so don't hesitate to leave your question!)\n\nEDIT: This was a lot of fun, thanks so much for asking all of your questions - there were some really great ones! I'll have to bookmark this myself so I can come back and re-read my answers, since I dropped most of my brain in here today haha. Catch you all next time or on X (hopefully past $10k MRR)! :D",

        "selftext": "I’m at the point where I just want to scream. Marketing is fucking hell. Organic growth is so goddamn slow it feels like torture. I put in endless effort, endless hours, and what do I get? A drip of visitors, a crawl of traffic, and the constant thought in my head: why the fuck am I even doing this?\n\nI used to see numbers moving, I used to get some traction, and now it’s like hitting a fucking brick wall every single day. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of posting, sick of trying to play games with algorithms, sick of grinding my face off for breadcrumbs\n\nFuck marketing.\nFuck PMF.\nFuck organic growth being slow as shit.\nFuck watching numbers crawl when I bust my ass.\nFuck the days I feel like giving up.\nFuck freelancing.\nFuck 9-to-5 bullshit\nFuck the grind that feels endless.\nFuck the silence after posting.\nFuck the thought that this won’t work.\n\nAnd fuck all of this frustration. It’s boiling me alive. I swear to god this shit makes me want to smash my head against the wall.\n\nBut fuck giving up even more. As much as this feels like pure hell, I’m not quitting. Not today. Not tomorrow. I’ll rage, I’ll curse, I’ll break apart but I’ll still show up. Even if it kills \n\n\nEdit : Hey, seriously thank you for all the support, the advice, and even the pushback. marketing is brutal. I’m learning, I’m grinding, and yeah, I vented hard because sometimes it feels like hell.",

        "selftext": "I'm a freelance video editor and I’ve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up — and I’m not sure how to break the cycle.\n\nThis is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I’m open to anything.",

        "selftext": "I was asked last-minute to do a deep clean of an apartment for someone hosting a special event. The place was in rough shape including a lot of mould and I was encouraged to do as much as I could to get it looking right. I brought my own supplies, worked thoroughly, and postponed other things to fit it in because I was told the rate upfront and agreed on that basis.\n\nAfter the job was done, the owner told me she had “made a mistake” offering that rate and is now only willing to pay me half. This wasn’t discussed beforehand it only came up after I’d completed everything. I’ve tried to handle it calmly and professionally, but I feel really disrespected.\n\nI’m torn because she’s in my building and connected to people I know but I also don’t think it’s okay to change terms retroactively. \n\nWould love to hear how others would handle this or what you’d say in my shoes.\n\nEdit: it’s in writing and verbal, sent her a screenshot of her telling me the rate and she’s claiming it’s a mistake!\n",
