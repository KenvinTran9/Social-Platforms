Though it would be considered a small business (80 employees and one owner) the company is very successful, debt free, and grosses roughly 50m revenue/ year. This morning I received the following email from the president (owners nephew training to take over after owner retires)\n\n\nTeam,\n\nAs we do each year we have secured a holiday present for Owner.  Owner eats quite a bit of fish so we got him a monthly subscription for a year from *company*.\n\nEach person’s contribution is $100.  Please venmo me when you have a chance. \n\n\nThere were 17 people on the email chain, so they are anticipating collecting $1700 for this gift. This was not discussed, and based on the email, did not seem to be posed as optional. \n\nMy first instinct was to report the email as phishing because I thought there's no way this guy is asking us all to Venmo him $100, but when I looked at the recipients, it seemed legit. Head of HR and IT were both on the To line.\n\nAm I crazy for feeling like this is a bit much? Can't we just get the guy a tie? Isn't our gift to him the labor we put in to make him his several million dollar salary? \n\nShould I report the email? Send the Venmo? What will happen if I just don't do anything, are they going to follow up? I don't want to come off as cheap or unappreciative. I get paid well and I think the owner is great, but this all seems so odd to me. ",

Not because of luck, but because I believed in the thing itself. It was clean, useful, simple. I built it the way I wished more things online were built. And for a few hours it felt like the internet finally noticed. Then the numbers just kept going down every day. Retention was almost nonexistent. Repeat visits were basically statistical noise.\n\n\nThe silence after a spike hits differently when you genuinely believe in what you’re making. It’s not “maybe this sucks.” It’s more like, “nobody stayed long enough to even know if it was good.”\nNobody really talks about that part.\n\n\nYou can pour years into something solid and the world will shrug like it’s another tab to close. Quality doesn’t magically earn attention; they're two separate battles.\n\n\nThe crash did shake my belief for sometime. But it was a reminder that real traction isn’t a moment. It’s built quietly, brick by brick, when nobody’s watching\n\nThe thing I wish I knew earlier is this:\n\nThe graph isn’t the work\n\nThe work starts after the graph collapses\n\nJust wondering how many people here have had that same “false dawn” moment, the surge that feels like a breakthrough, followed by the silence that punches you in the ego.\n\nWhat did yours end up teaching you?",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
