I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads. I came up with a brand true to me, an awkward autistic woman.\n\nAnd it worked. Owners who told me no before are now telling me yes. \n\nIt is all thanks to the only people that told me my llc was shit. \n\nLove you, r/smallbusiness",

I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

Growth stoped (I mean that rapidly). 2020 year outside and I decided to do something for myself and launch own side projects. For 4 years I've been trying to build something that ppl will use. Sometimes I did it alone, sometimes with co-founders. In the end - none of my 6+ projects made it any further then 10-20 semi-active users. I know the mistakes I made and this post is not about HOW-TO or HOW-NOT-TO, but rather - what you guys do when your life turns into a complete uncertainty and there is no clear way forward?\n\nI took a month of break of doing absolutely nothing to kinda reset myself. Yet I still think I have to do something in the side-project area (btw, I work 9-5 as well so that's why I call it side- project). But I have more questions then answers.\n\nAll the AI hype is becoming really scary. I see little to no founders who actually raised VC funds but was able to move on significantly (take YC updates - 99% of all their alumnis are not even live after pre-ceed).\n\nOpenAI and others are releasing one feature after another that kills lots of startups that worked on it before. And I mean, yeah, it makes sense. \n\nSo what am I suppose to do? Ignore all the noise and still double down on GPT wrappers and do as everyone does - apply to YC and hope my stuff will actually work? Or shall I double down on my corporate work, admit I'm a bad founder and move on with 9-5? I'm 36yo and apparently time is of the essence. Or, maybe kill that founder mood and search for co-founders and just be a founding engineer?\n\nWould really love to hear from ppl in similar boat (if there are such). Cheers!",
