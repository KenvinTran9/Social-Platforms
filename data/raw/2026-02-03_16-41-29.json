Every morning feels like pushing a boulder uphill. There's no one I can turn to and say \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" or \"I'm exhausted\" without it affecting morale or their sense of job security. I have everyone analyzing my personality to see if I'm cut out for it, and I don't care to have all this pressure (I know pressure is a privilege, but I've stopped feeling the passion).\n\nI catch myself being jealous of the stability of those who have a salary (I've never had one). It feels like each month I have no clue what the next month will entail. I resent the company now and the clients. I dream about sending a resignation email TO MYSELF. But if someone took my place I would rather die. My business is like my child and I've put multiple six figures into it.\n\nI KNOW I'm not built for a corporate job. And there ARE parts of what I do that I enjoy - I just can't seem to hold onto them under along with everything else. I know theoretically I have the power to shape this into something I love. I built it, so I should be able to rebuild it, right? But I have no clue how to get from where I am to where I want to be since I've gone so far.\n\nAnyone else been here?

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "If you are tired of posting on LinkedIn for 0 likes, hate the idea of sending 100 cold emails a day, or just feel like \"standard\" growth tactics are too slow, this is for you.\n\nI just hit $27k MRR with my new project, Rebelgrowth.\n\nAnd i did it by ignoring most of the standard \"SaaS advice.\"\n\nHere is the thing.\n\nEveryone focuses on the tool.\n\n\"Look at my AI wrapper.\" \"Look at my new feature.\"\n\nBut the money isn't in the tool.\n\nIt’s in the **Offer + The Funnel.**\n\nI learned this the hard way.\n\nBefore this, I sold my previous startup (CreativiU) to 7-figures.\n\nI spent years obsessing over what Russel Brunson teaches in Expert Secrets.\n\nAnd here is the \"ugly\" truth about how i actually grow.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Free Trial\" Offer**\n\nStop asking people to marry you on the first date.\n\nStandard 14-day free trials are boring. They have no urgency.\n\nFor my previous company, i used a \"free + shipping\" model. I gave away physical supplies and just charged $7.99 for shipping.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause getting someone to pull out their wallet changes the relationship.\n\nIt is 10x easier to upsell a customer who paid $7.99 than it is to convert a free user.\n\nI’m using this same logic for Rebelgrowth (an AI SEO tool).\n\nInstead of a generic trial, my offer is: **3 Days Free + First Month for $9.**\n\nThe regular price is $97/mo, which kicks in at Month 2.\n\nThis works because it stops the scroll.\n\nIt’s an \"unusual\" offer in a sea of sameness.\n\nThen, inside the app, I upsell to a $299 plan.\n\nThis \"tripwire\" approach covers my ad spend so i can acquire customers for essentially $0.\n\n**2. The \"Trojan Horse\" SEO Strategy**\n\nI love SEO, but waiting 6 months for traffic sucks.\n\nSo i cheat.\n\nI call this the **Trojan Horse Interview.**\n\nBack in the day, i started a marketing podcast.\n\nBut the goal wasn't listeners. The goal was backlinks.\n\nI would interview experts and run a \"contest\" for their audience.\n\nTo enter the contest, the guest had to host the participation guidelines on **THEIR** website.\n\nAnd guess what was in those guidelines?\n\nA juicy backlink to my site.\n\nThey got engagement/traffic. I got domain authority.\n\nWin-win.\n\n**3. Paid Ads (For people who hate losing money)**\n\nI treat ads like a vending machine.\n\nI put $1 in, i need to know when $2 comes out.\n\nI built a massive spreadsheet where every row is a touchpoint (CPM, CPC, Click rate, Churn).\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend, knowing i’ll be profitable in 3 months.\n\nMy strategy is stupidly simple:\n\n* **Meta:** I target broad. US + Europe. My creative is my targeting. I use UGC style videos (15-30 seconds). I use tools like Sora Pro to make hooks because i’m lazy.\n* **Google:** I only bid on **Competitor Keywords**. I don't use their name in the text (don't get sued), but i pin my \"$9 Offer\" in the headline.\n\n**4. Being an Early Adopter (The \"Shiny Object\" Strategy)**\n\nYou have to be where your competitors aren't.\n\nIn Nov 2025, i saw John Rush launch TinyAdz. I jumped on it immediately. Cheap traffic.\n\nWhen Marc Lou launched TrustMRR, I bought an ad spot instantly.\n\nIt was the best ROAS i’ve ever had.\n\nBut you win some, you lose some.\n\nI also burned $500 paying an X influencer who got me zero clicks.\n\nThe point is to move fast.\n\n**Summary of the playbook:**\n\n1. Create an irresistible, \"weird\" offer (low friction entry).\n2. Use that offer to liquidate your ad spend (break even immediately).\n3. Use \"Trojan Horse\" tactics for authority.\n4. Upsell the backend to make profit.\n\nMost people are trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.\n\nFix the offer (the bucket), and filling it becomes easy.\n\nHas anyone else tried a $1 or $9 \"tripwire\" offer for SaaS? Or is everyone still stuck on \"Freemium\"?\n\nBorja Obeso, founder [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

        "selftext": "When I started my agency, I thought that outbound is about numbers and didn’t notice that I was doing it completely wrong. There was neither focus nor structure - I was just sending tons of messages, hoping to catch a lead. When I noticed that we were not growing at all, I shut everything down for a week to review everything. I noticed who actually replied, which channels worked, what kind of messages felt natural.\n\nA few things completely changed how I approached outreach:\n\n* I understood that every good company is not a target market; it doesn’t bring more - it’s the opposite. So I wrote down size, industry, buying power, tech stack, and 80% of the companies I was chasing didn’t make sense.\n* I learned that different professionals live in different channels: C-level respond on LinkedIn in the morning, mid-level managers usually check emails after lunch, and sales pick up cold calls.\n* I didn’t have an organization system. I was just using linkedIn, notion for notes, google docs for templates, and a calendar. But it was a mess, so I had to learn how to build automated flows and manage it. Now, for me, it's a combination of pipedrive, sales navigator, and linked helper.\n* I realized people don’t react to lists of features, they react to the one thing that’s currently painful, so I began writing mini-essays about something specific.\n* Personalization is not {FirstName}; it’s showing that you looked at the person. I refer to recent posts or updates on their product or to something happening in the market.\n* I decided to track 3 metrics that really show the process and results: connection-to-meeting rate, reply rate by channel, win/loss ratio.\n* I decided to test changes in small bites - not to change the entire template or funnel, but only the CTA or only the hook. It showed better what really worked.\n\nNot saying it’s the right way to do outbound, but it really worked for me, so hope it helps.",
