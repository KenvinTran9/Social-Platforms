At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved up that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

I tried adding it in code but we have multiple apis and it got messy fast, customers were getting cryptic errors when they hit invisible limits. Moved rate limiting to gateway level where it knows what plan someone is on.

        "title": "How a single US policy change almost shut down my business overnight",
        "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",
