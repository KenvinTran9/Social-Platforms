        "selftext": "When I first got into the private jet business (no, I don‚Äôt own a jet), I thought I‚Äôd be selling these private jet flights to celebrities, billionaires, CEO‚Äôs etc. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the surging client base of Gen-Z‚Äôs, influencers, online gurus and dropshipping coaches. \n\nThe funny thing is that most of these people don‚Äôt even care about getting from A to B, most of them book the shortest route and some of them don‚Äôt even leave the ground‚Ä¶ they just want pictures, and videos of them on the jet sipping champagne lol\n\nAt first this was extremely weird and I ‚Äújudged‚Äù these people. Like why would they spend money just to flex on Instagram? It felt fake, very shallow. \n\nBut over time i realized that this was the product. The private jet is what people REALLY want. But they aren‚Äôt buying transportation, they are buying an image, a story of showing everyone ‚ÄúI made it‚Äù for most of them, painting this picture is more valuable than the jet itself. \n\nThe crazy is the absurdly MASSIVE demand for these fairly cheap private jet flights. I never imagined an entire market of people who aren‚Äôt rich but desperately want to LOOK rich. \n\nBut honestly, this was the best thing that could have happened to me because I don‚Äôt have to convince anyone to buy. The product (which is the jet flight) sells itself and I close those deals with little to no effort. \n\nThe lesson: sales isn‚Äôt always about the product you‚Äôre selling. It‚Äôs more about selling the feeling behind it and getting people emotionally invested. If you understand ego, you‚Äôll understand markets. \n\n ",

        "title": "My first startup fixed interview prep,  Now my second is replacing interviews - already $75K MRR before Launch",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Michael. Two years ago my co-founder and I hacked together a prototype called Meeting Copilot. It listened in on Zoom calls and suggested prompts. One user asked if it could help him in an interview ten minutes later. I said yes, charged him $99, and he paid on the spot. That was the spark.\n\nFrom there we built Final Round AI, an AI copilot for interviews. People called it cheating, we called it the future. One user had been unemployed for eight months but with us, he landed a job in 17 days.\n\nWe joined a growth bootcamp, shipped thousands of SEO pages, ran a thousand experiments, and grew from nothing to $10M ARR and seven million users in under two years. Along the way we raised a $7M seed, but the truth is most of the growth came from compounding small wins and killing the 90 percent of things that didn‚Äôt work.\n\nBut that journey revealed a bigger truth. Interviews don‚Äôt show you the truth. Real work does. Inside our own team, the best hires came from people who worked with us directly, not from polished resumes or interviews.\n\nSo we started doing something different - Paid Work Trial. Candidates would spend a day or a week actually working with us. It worked so well we stopped doing interviews completely. And that‚Äôs what became our next product.\n\n[Work Trial AI](https://worktrial.com/) lets companies run short paid work trials. In seconds you can launch a real-world sandbox where candidates solve real problems alongside AI colleagues and real team members. Every trial is different, no scripts, just raw proof of ability. Companies get a clear view of how someone communicates, solves problems, and works with others.\n\nOver the last six months we‚Äôve been running Work Trial AI with B2B companies we got connected to through our network of VCs and founders we already knew. The feedback has been amazing, faster decisions, stronger hires, and far less wasted time.\n\nToday we‚Äôre finally launching it for every company. We‚Äôve already grown to $75K MRR, but it‚Äôs not about the numbers. The mission is bigger. We want to reinvent how hiring works.\n\nHere are a few lessons that helped me along the way:\n\n* Don‚Äôt wait for the perfect idea. The spark often comes from a user doing something you didn‚Äôt expect.  \n* Raise your prices earlier than you think. If you‚Äôre delivering real value, people will pay.  \n* Run a lot of small experiments. Growth doesn‚Äôt come from one big hack, it compounds from hundreds of small wins.  \n* Network more than you feel like. Our earliest traction came from founders and VCs we already knew.  \n* Focus on solving real problems. If the pain is real, the product almost sells itself.\n\nOur first startup showed us the cracks in the hiring process. This next one is our attempt to fix them. Sometimes the first product gives you momentum, but the second one helps you solve the bigger problem.If you also believe hiring should be based on real work instead of guesswork, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n",

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI‚Äôm pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback¬†after I had delivered everything¬†- payment just got yanked back. üò©\n\nI‚Äôm shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",
