I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

It's been a good run, but after all these years I'm trying to figure out if now is the right time and what kind of valuation I should realistically expect.\n\nThe site is monetized through advertising, primarily Google AdSense (around 55%), though I've diversified over the years with other ad networks and direct sponsors. All traffic is organic (SEO-driven), and I run a very lean operation.\n\nLast 12 months the business did about $1.3M in revenue with roughly $1.16M in profit (around 90% margins).\n\nHere's where I'm struggling: I've heard wildly different numbers on multiples. Some say sites like this trade at 3x SDE/EBITDA (especially from competitors), while others mention 5-6x or even higher for strategic buyers who see specific synergies.\n\nFor those of you who've recently sold similar businesses, what kind of multiple did you actually get? And what should I be realistically targeting here?\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
