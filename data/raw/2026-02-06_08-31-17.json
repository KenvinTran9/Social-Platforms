        "selftext": "I run a food truck and about 40% of transactions are still cash despite having Square, people at festivals and street corners just prefer cash I guess. Problem is dealing with that cash is a nightmare, I can't mobile deposit it obviously, most ATMs don't accept deposits for business accounts, I have to physically go to a bank branch.\n\nMy bank branch closes at 4pm and I'm usually working until 7 or 8, so I end up carrying around hundreds or sometimes thousands in cash overnight which makes me nervous. I tried going to the branch on my day off but then I'm spending my only free time dealing with banking instead of resting or prepping for the next event.\n\nI looked into those smart ATMs that accept cash deposits but they're mostly for personal accounts, business account deposits require going inside to a teller. I asked my bank if they could just let me use the ATM for business deposits and they said it's against their policy, something about fraud prevention.\n\nSome food truck owners I know just spend the cash on supplies and inventory so they don't have to deposit it, but my accountant said that's a grey area for tax purposes and I should be depositing everything. I'm stuck between following the rules and wasting hours of my life going to bank branches during the only time they're open.\n\nHow are other cash based businesses handling this without losing their minds?",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about why some people build multiple successful startups while most others never get one off the ground, and the more I strip away the mythology, the more it looks like a simple equation rather than some mysterious talent.\n\nIf you look closely, the market already gives you most of the variables. Products already exist. Customers already pay for solutions. Pricing models are already validated. Revenue structures are proven. In other words, demand has already been solved. Yet people still act like they need to invent everything from scratch, when in reality that’s usually where momentum dies.\n\nOnce I understood this, my whole approach changed. I stopped treating startups as artistic projects and started treating them like repeatable experiments. If competitors are making money, the correct move isn’t to innovate wildly, it’s to align. Same pricing logic. Same revenue model. Same customer profile. If the market is already paying X for a solution and won’t pay X for yours, the issue isn’t price discovery. It’s sales, positioning, or distribution.\n\nThat’s where most founders lie to themselves. They say the product isn’t ready, or the timing isn’t right, or they need one more feature. But if you already know the market exists, then the only real question is whether you can communicate value well enough to convert attention into money. If you can’t sell after enough real attempts, the math is telling you something, and it’s not subtle.\n\nSo I started optimizing for throughput instead of perfection. Build the smallest thing that can be sold. Ship it fast. Try to sell it aggressively. If it doesn’t move after a meaningful number of attempts, kill it without drama and move on. No emotional attachment. Just data. Repetition compounds. Each cycle sharpens your understanding of what actually works.\n\nSales became the core function, not an afterthought. Not polishing features, not tweaking designs, but improving language. Pitch clarity. Objection handling. Distribution. After enough reps, outcomes become predictable. Either the market pulls, or it doesn’t. Both are valuable answers.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that once even a small amount of traction exists, everything downstream simplifies. Pricing debates disappear. Confidence increases. Even investors behave differently, because you’re no longer presenting a hypothesis, you’re showing evidence. At that point, fundraising isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about scaling something that’s already mathematically working.\n\nThe final variable I underestimated was accountability. I noticed I always performed better when other people were watching, when reputation was on the line. So instead of relying on motivation, I engineered pressure. Public goals. Daily execution. External expectations. Systems that make it uncomfortable to stall.\n\nThe conclusion I keep coming back to is this: success in startups isn’t about being smarter or more original. It’s about running the equation enough times without lying to yourself. Fast execution. Real sales attempts. Honest feedback. Kill what doesn’t work. Double down on what does. Statistically, if you do this long enough, something breaks through.\n\nMost people fail not because they lack ideas, but because they don’t run the equation enough times to let probability do its job.\n\nCurious how many people here see startups the same way—or are still stuck optimizing variables the market already solved.",

        "selftext": "I was laid off in October.\n\nAfter that, I applied to a lot of jobs, but barely heard back from recruiters. After months of silence, I stopped applying as aggressively and decided to finally act on an idea I’ve had for almost 5 years, to build something of my own and be my own boss.\n\nThat’s how my startup idea was born (still very early, mostly just me trying to make things work).\n\nSince then, I’ve tried everything I could think of:\n- applying for jobs\n- building a startup\n- posting on YouTube / Instagram (content cration)\n- learning, building, iterating\n\nAnd the result has been the same everywhere: almost zero response.\n\nNo users, no traction, no recruiter callbacks, no real encouragement.\n\nFriends and family don’t really support it (or maybe don’t believe in it). I don’t fully blame them, when there’s no visible progress, it’s hard for anyone to.\n\nNow I’m financially broke, mentally exhausted, and honestly demotivated. The stress has started affecting my marriage too, which hurts the most.\n\nI keep asking myself:\n- What am I doing wrong?\n- Am I approaching things the wrong way?\n- Is this just how it works before things click, or am I ignoring some obvious mistake?\n- How do you know when to persist vs when to pivot?\n\nI’m not posting this to promote anything or ask for sympathy.\n\nI genuinely want real feedback from people who’ve been through layoffs, failed startups, long job searches, or rebuilding phases.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place:\n- What helped you get unstuck?\n- What would you do differently if you were in my position?\n- Any hard truths I might need to hear?\n\nThanks for reading. Even writing this out feels heavy, but I figured honest questions are better than silent overthinking.",
