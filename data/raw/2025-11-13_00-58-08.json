        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "Small business has 15-20 employees. Most are part time, and a few are full time. One part time staff has asked if we plan to provide healthcare benefits (plus vision and dental) at some point. She has a daytime / full time job where she is getting benefits currently and said she would like to come over full time if we can provide benefits. She says that her current employer \"takes care of everything\" and that she does not pay any contribution to the plan. So I said I will look into it. For her plus her spouse and child, the total monthly premium on a mid-level package is about $2,200 per month if I did 100% employer contribution. For context she is support staff making $29 / hr.\n\nFor me it's too much of a stretch to justify at $26K annual benefits package for someone whose base is roughly $60K / yr. I could change the contribution rate to say 50/50, but then I'm not competitive with her current FT employer and I think the premium split at 50% would be prohibitive for her and her family anyway.\n\nSo the question is: how do small businesses do this? I know there are a lot of options out there, but for those of you that have been down this road, what did you learn along the way? What was the best option that you settled on? I'd really like to offer competitive comp packages, but health benefits seem especially difficult.\n\nThanks!",

I left a $140k/yr job for the uncertainty of building my own thing. The only constant was the problem I care about: since I was 12 I’ve wanted to mix technology with science-backed fitness, and now I finally am.\n\nWe launched a week ago for the whole world. There is a small but real trickle of paying users and recurring revenue ($1.8k MRR), and while it is nowhere near what I used to make, the sense of validation and the happiness lately are hard to describe. I am feeling 100x happier than when I was paid 10 times this.\n\nIf you are considering taking the plunge, my two cents: if you need the income, start as a side project. There are plenty of influencer gurus telling you to quit and stop being a “normie,” but living without a salary takes real mental strength. Questions pile up. Some days you will feel like it was not worth it. Other days, a tiny win will carry you for a week.\n\nNo pitch, no links. Just sharing my experience in case it helps someone who is on the fence.",
