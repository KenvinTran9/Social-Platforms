But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

Like \"why do you think the previous company failed\" and \"how would you structure a maintenance schedule for multiple properties\" and basically picking my brain about the whole operation side of things. At first I thought she was just chatty but then she asked if I'd be willing to sit down with their team and basically teach them how to vet landscaping companies properly because they kept getting screwed over\n\nI said sure and charged her for 2 hours of my time, didn't think much of it. She paid immediately and then referred me to two other property management companies. Now I do like 3 or 4 of these \"consulting sessions\" a month and honestly its become a solid income stream. I basically just tell them what red flags to look for, how to negotiate contracts, what questions to ask. Takes me barely any time and I've got some money saved up from just this alone that I'm putting towards new equipment\n\nThe weird part is I never planned this, never marketed it, it just kinda happened.

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",
