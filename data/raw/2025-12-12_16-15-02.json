        "selftext": "For 7 years I pushed through a career that looked great on paper but made me miserable. I finally walked away this year. No dramatic blow up, no big revelation, just the quiet realization that I could not keep pretending I enjoyed it.\n\nSince then, I bought half of a 40-year-old family business and started building a Miami-focused real estate platform. (Both sites were basically vibe coded by me with basic programming experience. Hiring them out would have been over $100k - irrelevant detail).\n\nWhat has been insane is the lifestyle freefall.\n\nI was always scared to become an entrepreneur because of this exact thing. Now I am living it.\nOne business is profitable but still early stage. The other is a startup that needs heavy lifting.\nBoth require marketing, ads, experiments, money going out before money comes in.\nI underestimated how competitive it is just to get attention. Meta ads, Google ads, creative testing, all of it. I really thought I could just show up and grow something. Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe hardest part?\nIgnoring the headhunters calling with mid six figure jobs.\nI know I can go back. I know I can make money tomorrow. But that is the life I spent years trying to escape.\n\nAnd then there is the identity shift.\nTelling girls I am building companies instead of being the finance guy at a big fund.\nNot casually dropping $200 on sushi like it is nothing.\nNot skiing every winter.\nNot having that easy, comfortable narrative of I am doing well.\n\nIt is humbling. Honestly, some days it is embarrassing. I did not expect it to hit this hard.\n\nBut I also have so much respect now for entrepreneurs who stuck through this phase and made it work. You do not realize how much grit it takes until you are the one staring at the ceiling at 3AM wondering if you are insane.\n\nRant over.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else went through this identity and lifestyle whiplash when switching from a high paying job to entrepreneurship.",

We applied for [our new SAAS. ](https://gojiberry.ai)  \n  \nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\n  \nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch. \n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

The Default Settings (The Trap)\nThe system defaulted my simple app to a 4 vCPU / 8 GiB RAM machine.\nThe cost? ~$1.00 - $3.00 per hour.\nIf you miss this setting and your app runs continuously (even just idle listening to requests), you are looking at a $700 to $2,000 monthly bill. For a side project.\n​2. The \"Minimal\" Settings (The Rip-off)\nI manually lowered it to the absolute minimum: 1 vCPU / 0.5 GiB RAM.\nThe cost? $0.219 per hour.\nLet's do the math: $0.22 * 24h * 30 days = ~$158 per month.\n​The Reality Check:\nA comparable VPS (0.5GB RAM) on DigitalOcean or Hetzner costs about $4-$6 per month.\nReplit is charging ~$158 for the same compute power if you need 24/7 availability.\n​That is a 3,000% markup.\n​They are banking on the fact that their new target audience (AI users) doesn't understand server pricing. They default you to enterprise-grade costs, and even their \"cheap\" option is astronomically expensive compared to industry standards.\n​To all the Vibe Coders: Be careful. Check your settings. Do not trust the defaults.\nTo Replit: If you claim to support builders, stop trying to bleed them dry with insane default configurations and predatory markups.",

        "selftext": "Launched with a free tier to drive adoption.\nUsers after 6 months: 1,000+\nPaying customers: 23\nFree-to-paid conversion: 2.3%\nFelt like failure until I looked deeper.\nWho the 1,000 free users actually were:\nStudents and hobbyists: 45% (will never pay)\nCompetitors doing research: 8% (definitely not paying)\n\"Just exploring\" signups: 31% (signed up, never logged in again)\nGenuine potential customers: 16%\nThe 23 paying customers all came from that 16%.\nWithin actual potential customers, conversion was 14%. Not terrible.\nWhat I learned:\nFree tiers attract everyone. Mostly people who aren't buyers.\nVanity metrics lie. 1,000 users sounds impressive. 23 customers is the reality.\nSupport load from free users is real. They expect help but pay nothing.\nFree users don't automatically become paid users. Different populations entirely.\nWhat I changed:\nLimited free tier significantly. Enough to see value, not enough to fully solve the problem.\nAdded friction to free signup. Required work email, brief survey about use case.\nFocused marketing on buyer personas, not general awareness.\nMeasured success by paid customers, not total users.\nNew results:\nTotal users: dropped to 400\nPaying customers: 41\nFree-to-paid conversion: 8.7%\nSupport load: down 60%\nRevenue: up despite fewer users\nQuality beats quantity.\nWould rather have 400 serious users than 1,000 tire-kickers.\nWhat's your free-to-paid conversion rate?\n",
