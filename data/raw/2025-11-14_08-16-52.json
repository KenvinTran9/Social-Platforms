        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

My SaaS scrapes fresh, publicly available B2B leads from Instagram without needing logins, cookies, or any sketchy stuff. It’s a straightforward tool that solves a real problem and has brought in revenue since launch.\n\nThe more I build, the more I’m convinced micro SaaS beats chasing VC rounds, at least for me. I see so many stories of teams raising big money, burning through it, and then stressing to raise again. Meanwhile, I just talk to my users, fix what matters, ship quick updates, and grow at a comfortable pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, getting to $5K to $20K MRR solo is real with high margins, freedom, and no pressure from investors or a big team. You don’t need a boardroom to make decisions, just a solid product and a handful of happy paying customers who give direct feedback.\n\nWould love to hear from other solo or small team founders. How’s your journey going? And if you’re still weighing startup versus micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if it helps.\n\nP.S. Thanks for all the questions and interest, seriously.
