        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I‚Äôve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result.

Unfortunately, recent weeks have seen a significant increase of post submissions that break the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/about/rules) in clear and obvious ways. We're at the point where more than 90% of the post submissions violate the rules.\n\nWhile some of this is the standard \"I didn't read the subreddit rules and don't understand that this isn't /r/forhire, so please hire me/work on my project\" stuff I am used to dealing with, I suspect a lot of the increase is due to AI. I have removed dozens of posts that are some iteration of \"go to Gumroad and buy this ebook/PDF/guide that will help you freelance\" (one even stated that its purpose was to help you create ebooks with AI to sell to freelancers). I have also removed dozens of posts of market research/promotional spam related to \"vibe coding\" tools.\n\nI've been moderating this subreddit for more than a decade (!), so I'm used to periodic surges of inappropriate posts because some YouTuber made a video telling people to submit things to Reddit, or because some virtual assistant course mandated that its students make marketing comments here, or because Reddit itself decides that increased posts and traffic are more important than subreddit rules and moderators' time. Unfortunately, I am currently at the point where I need the firehose of incoming spam to stop. I need at least a couple of days, but reserve the right to continue this until the end of the month.\n\nComments are on. Please be respectful.",

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they‚Äôre asking \"how is the project going?\" you‚Äôre already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.
