Ivy League. Stanford. MIT. Private prep schools that cost more per year than most people make. And if you check where they’re sending their kids, it’s not to trade schools or straight into entrepreneurship, it’s the same elite institutions.\nIf college is supposedly pointless, why do the richest and most influential people invest so heavily in elite education?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

I don't know if the the companies hire someone to bot reports or do the reporting themselves but the approach is the same: a ridiculous number of reports on old posts trying to trigger automatic removals.\n\nThat doesn't work here because we actually look at the posts that get reported. Reporting something that doesn't break our rules but makes you look bad isn't going to cause it to be removed.\n\nIf you as a subscriber have questions about these companies I'd suggest you search the sub to learn about them. If the posts are gone then someone has bullied the original posters into removing them. If you are an OP on one of these I encourage you to hold your ground on anything truthful you have posted. I'll stand with you and defend your right to post.\n\nIf you represent one of these companies you'd be well served by finding and stopping any company doing fake reporting on your behalf. If you'd like to discuss legal action you should know that Reddit legal is VERY familiar with posting law and any truthful post not made with malevolent intent is likely safe under US law. You can discuss it with them at length if you like paying your lawyers.\n\nTo everyone, thanks for reporting content that breaks our rules. We're in a long war against spam, fake content, AI slop, and abuse and your help in it is vital.
