        "selftext": "\n\nI run a small residential roofing company (just me + 4 guys, doing around $40k/month) and there's one competitor who's always been our biggest rival in the area. We're cordial at supply shops but definitely competing for the same jobs.\n\nLast week I found out (through our shared insurance broker, long story) that they've been straight up lying to clients about having a general contractor's license. Like they claim to be \"fully licensed and insured\" on their website, truck wraps, everywhere. But they're not. At all. Never have been. I checked the state licensing board myself - nothing under their business name or the owner's name.\n\nThe kicker? Three of their current clients are homeowners I gave quotes to in the last 6 months and lost the job to them. One lady SPECIFICALLY told me she went with them because \"they seemed more legit with all their certifications\" and she felt safer. These are $15k-30k jobs btw.\n\nNow I'm sitting here like... do I say something? Part of me wants to send a \"hey just fyi\" message to those homeowners because like, if something goes wrong on their roof and the guy has no license, their homeowner's insurance might not cover it?? But another part of me feels like that's sketchy territory and I'll just look like a salty competitor trying to poach clients.\n\nMy lead guy says absolutely not, \"let karma handle it\" and it'll eventually blow up in their face anyway. My wife thinks I have a moral obligation to say something, especially since unlicensed work can void warranties and insurance claims.\n\nBut also like... they're literally breaking the law and winning contracts because of it. In our state you NEED a contractor's license for jobs over $10k. This isn't just shady, it's straight up illegal, right?\n\nThe thing that's really eating at me is one of those clients is an elderly couple on a fixed income who scraped together money for a roof replacement. They're getting scammed by someone who might leave them with zero recourse if something goes wrong. That one bugs me the most.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I'm losing sleep over this and honestly just need some outside perspective from people who get it.",

Everything we did was based on a handshake, a few texts, and “we’ll figure it out later.” It felt easy and honest until real money got involved. That’s when things started falling apart. A few missed payments, miscommunication over who owned what and suddenly everyone remembered things differently. I had to learn the hard way that paperwork doesn’t kill trust it protects it.   \nNow, every deal, every partnership, even small projects it all goes in writing. It makes things smoother and honestly saves friendships too.  \nAnd I’ve kind of started seeing it the same way in my personal life. Even something like a prenup isn’t about mistrust its just being clear early, before emotions or money complicate things",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me.

I kept telling myself *maybe I’m just not cut out for this.* Everyone else seemed to “get it” except me.\n\nI almost quit.

No VC buzzwords. Just solving the exact pain I had in my own projects.\n\nI worked on it daily — not in huge heroic sprints — just *small improvements, every day.* Fixing onboarding. Tweaking landing pages. Improving exports. Answering emails. Making the output 5% better each week.\n\nFor a long time, nothing happened.\n\nThen slowly:\n\n* Designers started using it for their client websites\n* Indie founders started using it for product UI\n* My inbox stopped being quiet\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* The app just passed **tens of thousands of users**\n* I don’t have investors, employees, or a cofounder\n* It’s just me, my laptop, and a ridiculous amount of iteration\n\nIt still doesn’t feel “real.”  \nEspecially because for so long it felt like **I was failing in silence.**\n\n# The part no one tells you:\n\nYou don’t need a “big idea.”  \nYou don’t need a 12-slide deck or a growth plan.  \nYou don’t need to be loud on Twitter.\n\nYou just need:\n\n* One real problem\n* One real user who experiences it\n* The willingness to keep improving when no one is watching\n\n# The biggest lessons this time around:\n\n* **Onboarding matters more than features**\n* **Charging earlier is not rude — it’s clarity**\n* **Small daily iteration beats “big launches” every time**\n* **Most people quit right before things start compounding**\n\nIf you’re in the phase where it feels like *nothing is working* — don’t assume that means it’s not working.\n\nSometimes the difference between $0 MRR and $5K MRR is just **staying in the game long enough for compounding to show up.**\n\nMy app is called [**illustration.app**](http://illustration.app) — but the name doesn’t matter.
