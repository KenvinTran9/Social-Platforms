APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.

        "title": "How a cheap product from AliExpress accidentally inspired my business",
        "selftext": "Continuing the story about my path to Decords brand. In my previous post, I ended with the thought that I started noticing that numismatics, my \"gold mine,\" was gradually drying up. While I was selling off the last coins, I began thinking what next? I wanted something of my own.\n\nIt started by accident. I had a blank wall in my kitchen and wanted to liven it up. I went on AliExpress and found some decorative stickers for €8. They arrived, I stuck them on everything looked neat. I went to work, came back in the evening and they were all lying on the floor. \"Okay,\" I thought, \"I probably bought the cheap stuff.\"\n\nI went back to AliExpress, found a similar design, but for €30. I applied them and waited. A week later, they started peeling off too. I started analyzing. Is it the wall? The paint? The concrete? I read forums and reviews and realized it was a common problem. Chinese vinyl often has weak adhesive. I found European materials have different glue, different structure.\n\nI looked further: to produce this, I needed equipment costing about €500 plus materials. By that time, thanks to the coins, I had the money. I ordered it. It arrived. I set it up and loaded the roll. I cut some test shapes circles, stars and stuck them on. They held.\n\nNext stage: Design. A couple of videos on YouTube, a few hours in Illustrator and I created a beautiful tree. I cut it on black vinyl and put it on my wall. It looked awesome. And most importantly, it stayed put! Then friends came over.\n\n\\- \"Listen, that’s beautiful. Where did you buy it?\"\n\n\\- \"Nowhere. I made it. The machine is in the corner.\"\n\n\\- \"Can you make one for me?\"\n\nI made one. They installed it, and they liked it. Then they wrote: \"My relatives liked it too, they want to order. How much?\" I sat down, calculated the material and time, and gave a price. They agreed. I made it, delivered it, and they ordered more. That’s when the picture started to form in my head: why not try selling this seriously?\n\nI placed an ad on a local site. At the same time, I started registering the company I already had the starting capital. And since I had experience with eBay, I immediately started looking toward marketplaces. I started diving deeper, figuring out the details, and listing products. Orders started coming in first one a day, then three. A couple of months later, I realized: I can't handle this at home anymore. I needed an office.\n\nI rented my first space. I remember it clearly, 20 square meters. Small, but mine. Then I hired my first employee. And gradually, a small idea born in a kitchen grew into a full-fledged business first decorative stickers, then printing production, professional printers, machines, and a team. And just like that, because of one cheap product from AliExpress that simply fell off the wall, a business was born one that I've been running for almost 10 years now.\n\nMy conclusions: First, if those stickers hadn't fallen off, maybe none of this would have started. That failure made me dig deeper, look for a better solution, and eventually find my path. And second quality always wins. People are willing to pay if the product is genuinely good. \n\nThat’s the story.",

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",

No CTA. 40 demo requests.\n\nThe worst? A polished blog series written for an imaginary ICP. Zero conversions.\n\nYou’re not a publication. You’re solving a problem. Speak like it.\n\n\n\n**2. They sell results, not features**\n\nThe founders who scale fast are obsessed with one thing: outcomes.\n\nThey’re not selling automation. They’re selling “get 6 hours of your life back.”\n\nThey’re not selling dashboards. They’re selling “stop looking stupid in front of your boss.”\n\nGood messaging is obvious. Not clever.\n\n\n\n**3. They pick one channel and abuse it**\n\nOne founder I worked with built to $20k MRR off cold email alone.\n\nNo ads. No SEO. Just a painful problem and the guts to message 200 people a day.\n\nIf you’re doing five things at once, you’re doing none of them well.\n\n\n\n**4. They launch before they’re ready**\n\nThe fastest-growing SaaS I worked with had a landing page made in Notion and no product screenshots. Didn’t matter.\n\nThey validated the offer, closed 10 deals, then built the product.\n\nYou don’t need more marketing. You need proof someone wants what you’re selling.\n\n\n\n**5. They ask for help early**\n\nThe smart ones don’t wait until they’re drowning. One founder I worked with brought in ROI marketing around $4k MRR. Funnel was messy, ads weren’t converting, messaging was soft. One month later, it wasn’t.\n\n\n\n**The truth?**\n\nMost SaaS founders would rather “optimize” than sell.  \nBut if you’re not talking to buyers every week, you’re not in growth mode. You’re in hiding.\n\nYou want marketing that works? Do the scary thing.",
