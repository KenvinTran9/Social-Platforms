        "selftext": "I've been the hired gun for dozens of founders over the years. I've seen who makes it and who burns out.\n\nAnd honestly? The ones who win are usually doing things that \"SaaS Twitter\" would scream at them for.\n\nHere is the controversial stuff I see the winners doing while everyone else is busy polishing their landing page.\n\n**1. They are \"technically\" incompetent (and proud of it)**\n\nThe worst founders I work with are the ones who know a little bit of code. They micromanage the stack. They argue about React vs. Vue. They want to know why I'm not using the latest Vercel feature.\n\nThe winners? They don't care.\n\nThey ask me: \"Can you build this by Friday?\"\nI say yes.\nThey say: \"Great. I'm going to go sell it.\"\n\nThey treat technology as a utility bill. They pay it, it works, they move on. They spend 100% of their brain power on sales, not on architecture diagrams.\n\n**2. They ignore \"scalability\" until it's actually on fire**\n\nI had a client whose backend was literally a single massive Python script running on a $5 DigitalOcean droplet. It was hideous. It crashed once a week.\n\nHe scaled that thing to $30k MRR before he let me refactor it.\n\nWhy? Because rewriting code doesn't make money. Selling makes money.\n\nMost of you are building for 100,000 users when you don't even have 10. The winners build for 10 users, let the server catch fire at 100, and then pay me to fix it with the money they made.\n\n**3. They are annoying**\n\nThe successful founders are the ones who text me at 8 PM on a Tuesday saying \"I just promised a customer this feature, can we hack it together by tomorrow?\"\n\nIt's annoying for me as a dev. But it works.\n\nThey aren't building a product roadmap for next year. They are closing the deal in front of them right now. They force the product to evolve based on real cash, not hypothetical user personas.\n\n**4. They don't have a \"vision\"**\n\nThe founders who fail always pitch me a \"platform.\" They want to be the \"OS for X.\"\n\nThe founders who win pitch me a tool. \"I want to make it easier for dentists to send appointment reminders.\"\n\nThat's it. No ecosystem. No API marketplace. Just a tool that does one boring thing and charges $50/month.\n\nThey don't try to change the world. They try to solve a minor inconvenience for a specific group of people with money.\n\n**5. They launch embarrassing products**\n\nIf you aren't ashamed of your MVP, you launched too late.\n\nI've launched products for clients that still had \"Lorem Ipsum\" on the about page. Buttons that didn't work. Mobile layouts that were broken.\n\nAnd people still bought them. Because the core utility was valuable enough that users forgave the jank.\n\nIf you are waiting for perfection, you are just procrastinating.\n\n**The hard truth**\n\nWe like to think SaaS success is about building a beautiful, scalable, well-architected software product.\n\nIt's not. It's about selling a solution to a problem.\n\nThe code is just the delivery mechanism. The sooner you treat it like a commodity and focus on the business, the sooner you'll actually make money.\n\nRoast me if you want, but this is what I've seen work.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.
