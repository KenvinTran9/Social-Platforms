        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "title": "0 to $1M in 3 years: What it really takes",
        "selftext": "I started my company in 2023, and this year we're projected to hit somewhere between $1M and $1.5M in revenue. My goal of hitting $3-$5M in the next 3 years is very achievable at our current rate of growth. I'm going to give you the reality of starting and growing a business to $1M in 3 years, without sugar-coating it. If I burst some bubbles and dash some hopes with this post, then I've done my job. I won't divulge what my industry is because I'm discussing general business principles that apply to any industry. Different industries have different barriers to entry, and some businesses can scale faster than others. In Silicon Valley, hitting $1M in 3 years is pathetic. High growth tech startups can hit $10M three years after launch, but the barriers to entry in the industry are high. I'm speaking to the average person who wants to open a restaurant, launch a product or start a service business. What does it really take to build a successful company and scale it to $1M?\n\n1. Money. This is the hard truth nobody wants to hear. It takes money to start and scale a business, any business. I made an initial investment of $20k to get my business going. $20k is not a lot of money in the startup world. Most businesses require much more to get off the ground, but many wantrepreneurs are unable or unwilling to risk even minimal capital to get a real operation going. Can you start a business without investing a lot of money? Sure, but you're not going to scale your business to $1M quickly without starting capital. You're competing with other businesses that already have money to burn on marketing, operations, staffing and product/service development. If you don't have money or outside capital to launch a business, then you need to do it the old-fashioned way: work hard, live cheap and save. That might take years, but if immigrants who came to America with $3 in their pocket can start a dry cleaner or c-store this way, you can save money to start your business too.\n\n2. Marketing. I don't care how amazing your product/service is, if you can't get paying customers in the door, to your website, or on the phone, your business will go nowhere. This is probably the hardest part of getting a business off the ground. Marketing is mostly pay-to-play, so if you're just hoping to scale by building an organic social media following or going door-to-door, you will have a hard time growing to $1M. Developing a marketing plan that works requires a lot of trial and error. Whatever strategy you initially thought would win customers probably won't work as expected. You need to try a variety of marketing channels, track your ROIs, drop the ones that don't work, and invest more into the ones that do. Once you find a marketing strategy that works, it's like having a free money machine. The more you put into marketing, the more you make; The more you make, the more you can put into marketing, ad infinitum. However, the process of fine-tuning your marketing strategy will be difficult and costly. You need to be prepared to burn a lot of money on things that don't work, and always be ready to adapt and change your strategy. \n\n3. People. You can get a business going by yourself, but as you scale to $1M, you're going to need employees. In most industries, you probably can't handle a $1M operation by yourself. Too many business owners get stuck in the cycle of trying to do everything themselves, and their business stagnates as a result. Think of a new employee as an investment. They will cost you money in the beginning, but in time, a good employee will help grow your business and provide a return on your investment. Once you've built a good team, you need to learn how to delegate.  When you harness the power of delegation, an effectively managed employee is like making a copy of yourself. If you got your business to $250k by yourself, a two-person team can get you to $500k, three people to $750k, etc. (it's really not that simple, but you get the idea). You can't be in the trenches with your employees forever. As your business grows, you have to step out of the trenches so you can survey the battlefield, strategize and lead your troops. This is how you scale to $1M and beyond. I couldn't have done it without my team, and they couldn't have done it without effective leadership.\n\nStarting a business and growing it to $1M is insanely difficult. I know from hard experience that most of you will not succeed. Most wantrepreneurs won't get anything substantial off the ground at all, and of those that do, many will fail after a few years. This is simply the reality of entrepreneurship. However, if you are able to succeed, the satisfaction of building something scratch, being captain of your own ship, and reaping the reward of your hard work is the best feeling in the world.",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy.

Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

All they required from me were some python automations for their outbound systems and product maintenance. For the first time in nearly two years, I felt like myself again!\n\nNo more 14-hour days. No more second guessing my career decisions.\n\nWe were ready to launch and we planned our big sales push for the third week of July 2024.Then came the WhatsApp message.\n\nOur CSO’s 11-year-old son had been diagnosed with an incredibly rare form of cancer.\n\nWe’ve been friends since high school. When I read that message, it felt like my heart had been ripped out.For me, I immediately felt useless to him.\n\nOn a personal level, I was literally powerless - I couldn’t make this better and I was so sorry for him.On a professional level however, I could help as SOMEONE had to step into his role.\n\nThe 14-hour days returned. But this time, it felt different.\n\nWith the perspective of what my co-founder was going through, every “big problem” at work that used to consume me felt LAUGHABLY small.\n\nProblems no longer consumed me - it was surreal! They began to roll off.\n\nI also had to jump headfirst into sales, marketing, and investor conversations. Things I once found terrifying and thought that I’d be terrible at - quickly became second nature.\n\nAnd through all of this, our CSO even closed investors during this time! So the company didn’t just survive, it grew!\n\nHere are the three biggest lessons I walked away with:\n\n1. **You’re capable of WAY more than you think!** I NEVER imagined that I’d EVER thrive in sales and fundraising. I am by nature a dork that likes to sit in dark rooms and build stuff  but necessity forced me to grow and now I have skills for life.\n2. **No problem is big in the grand scheme of things.** Bugs, investors or angry customers can sometimes present problems that feel so big, it feels like the world is going to end. That’s until you’re reminded of what a “big” problem really is and your whole perspective shifts.When I face the scent of a shit sandwich now, I now think about how lucky I am that these are my ONLY problems.\n3. **Know where you are in the product lifecycle.** Startup, scale, maturity - understanding your CURRENT stage helps you focus when the world shifts under your feet. There are times to be simultaneous with product strategy and times to be systematic! You need to know which… \n\nSo here’s some good news!\n\nA couple of months ago, our CSO's son was given the all clear! Even better, he was featured in Season 4 of the Disney+ series “Welcome to Wrexham\\*” -\\* which was awesome!\n\nThis whole experience made me appreciate how much support matters and after going through it - we would have loved to have had a community to ask questions to.\n\nSo I have set up a free community for SaaS founders that can share their struggles, wins and support each other with in depth discussion on SaaS topics!\n\n[If you would like to join, just click here!](https://www.skool.com/saas-life-5260/about?ref=1055b1ef676f4069a9ad1cbe488b965e)\n\nWe’ve got founders at every stage: some just starting, others who’ve exited for millions, all supporting and learning from each other.\n\nJust incase this isn't obvious, this IS NOT my SaaS. It is a free community for founders that I started as a result of the above events.",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback after I had delivered everything - payment just got yanked back. 😩\n\nI’m shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I’m trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",
