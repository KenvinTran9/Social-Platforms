        "selftext": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

        "selftext": "I run a small web design agency and about 5 months ago I had this client who paid upfront for a full ecommerce site. Long story short, they kept changing their mind every week, wanted completely different designs, then finally just ghosted me after I sent the third mockup.\n\nI refunded them 60% (kept some for the work I actually did) and honestly felt like crap about it. But here's where it gets interesting.. I was venting to another client about it during a call and she was like \"wait you actually give refunds? most agencies I've worked with ironclad contracts\"\n\nThat got me thinking. I started offering a \"trial design sprint\" where clients pay like $800 for a 5 day intensive where we build out 3 homepage concepts and a basic site structure. If they don't like ANY of it, full refund no questions asked. Sounds risky right?\n\nTurns out people LOVE this. I've done 26 of these since August and only had to refund twice. The conversion rate to full projects is insane, like 85%. Most clients are just scared of committing $8k to someone they found online, but $800 to test the waters? Easy yes.\n\nWhat really surprised me is I'm actually making more per hour on these sprints than my regular projects because theres no scope creep. Already had some money saved aside but this has basically doubled what I can put away each month which feels pretty solid.",

Like I showed them the supply costs, explained labor hours, even mentioned that I keep some money saved aside for equipment replacements that I factored into pricing.\n\nThey ended up booking it AND referred their realtor to us. Now I do this with most estimates when people seem hesitant and my close rate went from like 40% to almost 70%. People seem to actually appreciate seeing where their money goes instead of just getting a final number.\n\nI thought being transparent would make me look amateur or unprofessional but its been the opposite.

Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me.

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half.

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.

        "selftext": "I am not a coder. I work at a local bank in Gunma, Japan, and have spent 20 years looking at loan contracts for small businesses. I’m a 40-year-old father trying to understand how this new world works.\n\nTo talk to you, I spent hours researching your terminology like \"Technical Debt.\" I am sorry if my usage is awkward, but I found a deep connection to my world of finance.\n\nIn banking, we think about \"Amortization\" (how long an asset lasts). \nIf you build a \"Pop-up store\" (a prototype), move fast. Use AI and libraries. That's good business. \nBut if you are building a \"Shrine\" (a core system) to last 20 years, the cheapest way is actually \"**The Forging**\" (鍛錬) way. In Japan, the best katanas are forged by folding the steel thousands of times. Software is the same. You must fold the logic again and again by building from scratch until it becomes part of you.\n\nI see many startups drowning in \"Technical Interest.\" They take \"loans\" by using easy AI code without understanding the core. In banking, a loan without a repayment plan is just a disaster.\n\nIn Japan, we have a concept: \"Chiko-Goitsu\" (知行合一). Knowledge and action are one. \nReading about code isn't enough if your hands move slower than your brain. The friction of struggling without AI—**The Forging**—is where the real skill is born.\n\nIs the \"move fast\" culture making us forget the value of **The Forging**? I am just a banker, but I wanted to hear your professional thoughts.\n",
