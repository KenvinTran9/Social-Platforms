        "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder & CEO of gliltech software",

Writing a business plan *feels* productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly. But it's also the world's most elaborate procrastination technique.\n\nHere's the thing - your business plan is going to be wrong. Not slightly off. *Catastrophically* wrong. Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I've always been happy to help him out, but last week, things took a turn.\n\nHe came in on a Saturday, and I had to tell him I couldn't give him a free burger because I was running low on product. I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

        "selftext": "I keep seeing new AI tools and startups popping up every week, but I’m curious how many of them are actually turning a profit.\n\n* Has anyone here built an AI-based business that’s working out?\n* Something that brings in real revenue, not just a cool side project or a few free users.\n* What are you building, and what’s been the hardest part so far?\n* Finding customers? Keeping up with new tech? Figuring out pricing?\n\nAlso wondering if most of you are using AI to build new products, or if you’re just adding AI to stuff that already works with the help of AI service providers.\n\nWould love to hear what’s been working (and what hasn’t).",
