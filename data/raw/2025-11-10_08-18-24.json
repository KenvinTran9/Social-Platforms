        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

        "selftext": "Hey, I need some real talk from anyone who’s been burned by a \"partner.\" This is a tough situation for me.\n\nI'm a young dev, still in high school, but I'm the single technical brain behind everything this company does. My boos, let's call him \"visionary man\", is all sales and big promises. I'm the one who built the whole stack: Rust/Node APIs, Tauri/React desktop apps, manages all the servers, load balancing, database. I literally build all the engine for all high-stake client projects.\n\nThe amount of work done is huge, the pressure is constant, but the pay is nonexistent. For months, our Whatsapp chat has been a broken record: me begging for my weekly pay, and him giving the excuses: \"I'm at zero\", \"waiting for money to come in,\" or just to busy flying around. To keep me motivated, he only keeps talking up about the future, how we'll \"get rich\" later with his next big project ,and that I just need to be patient.\n\nThe whole thing blew up recently. He's obsessed with this personal project, and when it slowed down because I was actually focusing on my school and personal stuff, he went off on me. He accused me of not being dedicated, compared me to his own insane workload. He then threatened my financial stake: he warned that if he has to invest more of his own money to keep his pet project moving, **the whole percentage picture changes.**\n\nThis is the bottom line: I built the business assets, but he treat my labor like free capital, and now he's threatening my future.\n\nI need some advice of what decision should take, i don't have any experience with this things. What would an experienced entrepreneur do?\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions and provide more information about the situation, without revealing any personal details about the project or the company.\n\nSorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.\n\n\\[IMPORTANT EDIT\\]\n\nThank you for all the advice you've given me in this post. I think there were many details I didn't mention because I assumed they were obvious (obviously my mistake).\n\n* I'm 16 years old\n* I live in Venezuela\n* I never signed a contract to work for this person\n* I don't have legal permission to work\n* My boss has government connections, so it's unlikely I'd win in a legal battle.",

        "selftext": "Everyone wants to know how to get their first users because going from 0 to 1 is the hardest part.\n\nI know because I’ve been there myself, we all have.\n\nSince I’ve passed this point I feel like I owe it to the community to share how I did it. It’s what I would’ve wanted to know when I started out and was struggling.\n\nSo, here is the simple path I took to reach my first 100 users:\n\n* My absolute first users came from when I validated my idea on Reddit, so that’s where I’ll start.\n* I wanted to solve a problem I experienced myself and had an idea for a solution.\n* Instead of jumping straight into building I started by reaching out to my target audience.\n* So I created a post titled “Let’s exchange feedback!” and posted it in r/SaaS and r/indiehackers\n* The post quickly explained that I was looking for feedback on my idea, wanted to understand the problem better, and would give feedback in return to anyone who responded to the survey.\n* After posting it a couple of times I had around 8-10 responses. It wasn’t a lot but there were enough positive signals for me to go for it.\n* After this I spent around 30 days building an MVP.\n* When it was finished, I DMed those same people who had responded earlier and also created a launch post in their subreddit.\n* This got me my first 3 users.\n* After this small “launch”, my marketing strategy was posting and engaging in founder communities on X and Reddit.\n* My “secret” to success on X was doing high volume. I set a goal of posting 3 times/day and doing 30 replies/day.\n* Posts sharing that I got my first 3 users, then 5, and then 10 shortly after, made people interested in checking out my product. They wanted to find out why it was growing.\n* With my 30 replies I tried to find people asking relevant questions where my product could help them. I tried to be as helpful as I could first, and then I also mentioned how my product might be useful for them.\n* So sharing my journey in public like this, engaging with my target audience, and posting on Reddit whenever something had performed well on X, led to my first 100 users in two weeks.\n\nSo that’s what I did to get my first users. It worked for me and I hope it works for you too so you can get your first users.\n\nThis method didn’t cost any money and it allowed me to ship fast and start improving my product quickly based on feedback.\n\nAnd using feedback to constantly improve my product is how I’ve managed to get it to where it is today at 20,000+ users.\n\nI hope this helped!\n\nEdit - [My SaaS](https://aicofounder.com) for those asking",

        "selftext": "I am working from home, a 27F. Honestly it gets boring and i dont have any friends in here in my hometown. I have lived in hostel since 15 and hence havent made any friends here.\n\nMy hometown is also not a lively place with meetups or activities happening, so it just becomes difficult for me.\n\nAny other way to socialise? maybe any online ways? Please suggest.\n\nUpvote1Downvote1Go to comments  \n",
