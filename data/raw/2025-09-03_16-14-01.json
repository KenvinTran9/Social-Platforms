        "selftext": "I started my company in 2023, and this year we're projected to hit somewhere between $1M and $1.5M in revenue. My goal of hitting $3-$5M in the next 3 years is very achievable at our current rate of growth. I'm going to give you the reality of starting and growing a business to $1M in 3 years, without sugar-coating it. If I burst some bubbles and dash some hopes with this post, then I've done my job. I won't divulge what my industry is because I'm discussing general business principles that apply to any industry. Different industries have different barriers to entry, and some businesses can scale faster than others. In Silicon Valley, hitting $1M in 3 years is pathetic. High growth tech startups can hit $10M three years after launch, but the barriers to entry in the industry are high. I'm speaking to the average person who wants to open a restaurant, launch a product or start a service business. What does it really take to build a successful company and scale it to $1M?\n\n1. Money. This is the hard truth nobody wants to hear. It takes money to start and scale a business, any business. I made an initial investment of $20k to get my business going. $20k is not a lot of money in the startup world. Most businesses require much more to get off the ground, but many wantrepreneurs are unable or unwilling to risk even minimal capital to get a real operation going. Can you start a business without investing a lot of money? Sure, but you're not going to scale your business to $1M quickly without starting capital. You're competing with other businesses that already have money to burn on marketing, operations, staffing and product/service development. If you don't have money or outside capital to launch a business, then you need to do it the old-fashioned way: work hard, live cheap and save. That might take years, but if immigrants who came to America with $3 in their pocket can start a dry cleaner or c-store this way, you can save money to start your business too.\n\n2. Marketing. I don't care how amazing your product/service is, if you can't get paying customers in the door, to your website, or on the phone, your business will go nowhere. This is probably the hardest part of getting a business off the ground. Marketing is mostly pay-to-play, so if you're just hoping to scale by building an organic social media following or going door-to-door, you will have a hard time growing to $1M. Developing a marketing plan that works requires a lot of trial and error. Whatever strategy you initially thought would win customers probably won't work as expected. You need to try a variety of marketing channels, track your ROIs, drop the ones that don't work, and invest more into the ones that do. Once you find a marketing strategy that works, it's like having a free money machine. The more you put into marketing, the more you make; The more you make, the more you can put into marketing, ad infinitum. However, the process of fine-tuning your marketing strategy will be difficult and costly. You need to be prepared to burn a lot of money on things that don't work, and always be ready to adapt and change your strategy. \n\n3. People. You can get a business going by yourself, but as you scale to $1M, you're going to need employees. In most industries, you probably can't handle a $1M operation by yourself. Too many business owners get stuck in the cycle of trying to do everything themselves, and their business stagnates as a result. Think of a new employee as an investment. They will cost you money in the beginning, but in time, a good employee will help grow your business and provide a return on your investment. Once you've built a good team, you need to learn how to delegate.  When you harness the power of delegation, an effectively managed employee is like making a copy of yourself. If you got your business to $250k by yourself, a two-person team can get you to $500k, three people to $750k, etc. (it's really not that simple, but you get the idea). You can't be in the trenches with your employees forever. As your business grows, you have to step out of the trenches so you can survey the battlefield, strategize and lead your troops. This is how you scale to $1M and beyond. I couldn't have done it without my team, and they couldn't have done it without effective leadership.\n\nStarting a business and growing it to $1M is insanely difficult. I know from hard experience that most of you will not succeed. Most wantrepreneurs won't get anything substantial off the ground at all, and of those that do, many will fail after a few years. This is simply the reality of entrepreneurship. However, if you are able to succeed, the satisfaction of building something scratch, being captain of your own ship, and reaping the reward of your hard work is the best feeling in the world.",

        "title": "I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.",
        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:\n\nI’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

        "selftext": "This is a lessons learned I wish I didn't have to share.\n\nA few months ago, I started a simple creative solo local business as a side gig, and as soon as I had joined my local Chamber of Commerce, I got spammed with calls from the BBB that made me think I was missing out. Their salesman was very good in making me feel like there was an urgency to address this.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth, I hate to admit that I got ~~coerced~~  convinced into getting a membership with them. They charged me for a full years amount even though I asked for a monthly (to test it out). After a very angry phone call, I convinced them to refund me the full amount and put me on a monthly plan, again to test it out. However, my instincts made me INSIST on having a written confirmation by the salesman that I have 120 days to cancel and have a full refund emailed to me. I'm so glad I did.\n\nI put a calendar reminder in about 3 months to cancel the membership (because the plan was always to get out of this mess). The time has come, and after replying to that same email confirmation of a refund, I gave them a call to start the process. The same guy tried to pull on the sleazy salesman tactic, which I was having none of, and he was trying very hard to get me off the phone call. First by saying I actually OWED them hundreds of dollars for the remainder of the year, then switched to saying they'll leave me active for another month and then maybe cancel, neither of which he had any ground to stand on.\n\nFinally, when he said they'll just cancel the membership with no refund it's been over 90 days, I asked him to help me understand what part of (copy/pasta from the email) \"*If you decide to cancel your membership, we will refund the dues that you have paid, up to 120 days. Any cancellation beyond 4 months, no refund will be given on any dues paid to that point*\" does this apply to? He flat out asked me if I have that in writing, to which I pointed back to the very email he wrote to me and I replied to.\n\nThis sleazy salesman said they'll cut me a check, he's very busy and has to get back to work, then ended the call immediately before I said another word.\n\nI'm now keeping my eye on my credit cards, waiting to confirm my cancellation, and then will block every BBB number that calls me.\n\nTHE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU IS A SCAM ORGANIZATION.

        "selftext": "Many freelancers struggle to keep clients and get referrals. There are four simple rules I adhere to:\n\n1. Always overdeliver. Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",
