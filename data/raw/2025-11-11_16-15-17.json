        "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’m hoping for some guidance across a few subreddits because I feel like I'm at a breaking point.\n\nI’m almost 40 and make about $70k a year, but after a lot of self-reflection and working with a professional, I’ve confirmed that my mental health issues are coming directly from the work itself. I’ve tried switching jobs, but everything I’m qualified for ends up being another desk job. And I just can’t do it anymore.\n\nI’d rather work 60+ hours a week *for myself* than keep forcing myself through a 9–5 where I’m chained to a computer. I don’t need to be rich—I just need to be stable and sane.\n\nI live in a rural area (Sayre, PA). Here, everyone and their cousin runs a handyman service, landscaping business, or garden business—so breaking into those feels like fighting over scraps. I don’t have a trade license, and I can’t afford to reboot a whole career while paying my mortgage.\n\n**But I** ***do*** **have $70,000 saved right now that I can put toward building something of my own.**\n\nMy question is:  \n**What can someone in my position reasonably do with $70k to break free from traditional office work and build a self-sustaining career?**\n\nI’m open to:\n\n* Service-based businesses\n* Mobile businesses\n* Online/remote businesses that *aren’t* corporate desk jobs\n* Buying equipment and starting something myself\n* Anything that gets me out of a cubicle and gives me control over my schedule\n\nI’m not afraid of long hours. I’m not afraid of hard physical work. I just need something that isn’t slowly destroying my mental health.\n\n**If you were in my situation—rural area, almost 40, $70k saved, burned out from office life—what would you do? What opportunities am I not seeing?**\n\nAny real-world advice or ideas from people who’ve made a similar transition would mean a lot.\n\nThank you.",

They say stuff like “you don’t need a degree get into the trades, start a business, just grind.”\nBut then you look at the backgrounds of the most successful founders, CEOs, VCs, and elite professionals… and where do they come from? Ivy League. Stanford. MIT. Private prep schools that cost more per year than most people make. And if you check where they’re sending their kids, it’s not to trade schools or straight into entrepreneurship, it’s the same elite institutions.\nIf college is supposedly pointless, why do the richest and most influential people invest so heavily in elite education?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",
