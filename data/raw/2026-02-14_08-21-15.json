        "title": "Cousin’s fiancée wants 10% equity in my software company for one client introduction. Cousin is pressuring me to sign. Am I wrong for refusing? I will not promote",
        "selftext": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "title": "The cold call opener that gets me past gatekeepers 42% of the time.",
        "selftext": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

        "selftext": "got product hunt featured. 2000 signups in 48 hours. team was ecstatic. champagne emoji in slack.\n\nby day 5 our onboarding flow was broken because we built it for 10 users not 2000. support inbox exploded. half the signups were other founders doing competitive research. the other half tried it once and bounced because we had no real retention loop.\n\nby week 2 our daily active users were lower than before the launch. but our costs were 4x higher because we panic-scaled infrastructure for traffic that was already gone.\n\nthe worst part is everyone kept congratulating us. people were sharing our launch numbers. other founders were asking us for advice on how to launch. we were dying and nobody could tell because the vanity metrics looked incredible.\n\nlaunch day is not a strategy. its an event. and if your product cant survive tuesday at 3pm when nobody cares, the launch just accelerated your death.",
