        "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years now. Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "As a \"founder\" in my job title, I attracted several people asking to share and promote my business to their linkedin fanbase.\n\nSome were cheap, starting at $100 but I noticed these people were hungry so I got a few to tone it down to as low as $20 per post.\n\nSo these guys have profiles with 10k-100k followers, and I notice they're quite active so I bite, because I just want to try it out and I can afford it.\n\nSo these guys start sharing my business, their posts explode with 300-500 likes, the comments are basically what I read on linkedin posts every day, interests, questions, some snarky replies as well. Pretty authentic. Lots of marketers, software devs\n\nSo I start answering some of these people, and nothing. Even the \"heavily interested\" commenters lead to zero responses.\n\nI check my website analytics, zero referrals from linkedin, literally.\n\nTotal spent: $150  \nTotal posts: 6  \nTotal likes: \\~3500  \nTotal comments: \\~500  \nVisitors in page: 0  \nConversions: 0  \nDM responses from \"interested people\": 0\n\nIt's literally bots. Bots everywhere. \n\nNow I'm thinking, even the most authentic looking linkedin thread is just a bunch of bots who have automated their linkedin to take the thread into context and create a comment.\n\nMight even close linkedin now as well as pull off my business page from it.
