I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

But sometimes it's just a nice conversation.\n\nAnd if you're building your own thing (language-related or not), Reddit is seriously underrated.

Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.\n\nLatest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself \"next time I’ll be better,\" but then… same thing.\n\nI don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this?

Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

        "selftext": "Here’s a simple and effective method to extract followers from any LinkedIn company page and turn them into leadsI tested it yesterday and pulled over 75,000 profiles, results were solid.\n\nHere’s how it works :\n\nStep 1: Create a new LinkedIn account  \nStep 2: Start a free trial of Sales Navigator  \nStep 3: Add a job title on your profile like “Intern” at the company you want to target  \nStep 4: In Sales Navigator, use the filter “People following my company”, this becomes available since LinkedIn thinks you’re part of that company  \nStep 5: Export the list, enrich the data (email, role, etc), and use it in your outreach  \nStep 6: Remove the intern job, pick another company, repeat the process\n\nSuper useful to build targeted lists from pages that already gather your ideal audience\n\nPS: For those who think this isn’t ethical, while they’re scraping likes, comments from influencers, or using Sales Navigator, it’s exactly the same thing.",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback after I had delivered everything - payment just got yanked back. 😩\n\nI’m shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I’m trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",
