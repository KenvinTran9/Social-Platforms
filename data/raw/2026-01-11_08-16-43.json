BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost.

At some point you realize you’re effectively consulting for free, but it feels awkward to interrupt because nothing explicitly changed.\n\nWhat took me a long time to see is that the shift isn’t emotional, it’s linguistic.\n\nEarly messages sound exploratory. Later messages start narrowing scope. They reference specific sections. They assume continuation. The person isn’t asking *if* you can help anymore, they’re implicitly assigning you work.\n\nOnce I started paying attention to the language instead of the vibe, setting boundaries stopped feeling as awkward for me. The conversation had already moved. I just hadn’t noticed.\n\nCurious if others have noticed the same thing or how you handle that transition without killing the relationship.",

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
