        "selftext": "Having worked corporate 9-5, been through redundancy, and with all this AI will replace you soon talk happening, I knew I wasn't looking to go back to that way of working. So I started thinking, if I had to start a physical business today, what would it be?\n\nI kept coming back to car wrapping, I don't know why but it's something that clicks for me. It has decent margins, is a growing market and has visual results that sell themselves.\n\nBut then I worked backwards through what I'd actually need:\n\n* Prime location (expensive)\n* Professional equipment (£££)\n* Vinyl suppliers and storage\n* Tools and workspace\n* Months learning to wrap professionally myself, or hiring experienced staff with salaries\n\nEven after all that investment, I'd still need to figure out how to get customers.\n\nSo I flipped it and just pretended I already had all that infrastructure and jumped straight to the marketing stage.\n\nI built a focused landing page targeting specific UK postcodes and areas. One offer, one goal, zero distractions - pure landing page fundamentals.\n\n**Results after the first few weeks:**\n\n* £45k worth of quoted wrap jobs\n* £15k worth of closed deals\n* Built 2 additional landing pages for different auto services like remapping\n\nMost of my time now goes into finding quality partners who can actually fulfill these leads.\n\nThis is actually harder than it sounds. Partner with a one-man band (no matter how skilled), and they're spending all day wrapping cars, they might get back to you with quotes in the evening... if you're lucky. \n\nBut I'm a firm believer in speed-to-lead when it comes to closing deals. That response time can make or break conversions.\n\nThis wouldn't be complete without mentioning AI, but not the usual shit.\n\nAll leads go into a simple table, then when I get manual quotes from suppliers, I enter them alongside the vehicle details (make, model, trim). Over time, I've built up a comprehensive database of quotes for specific vehicles.\n\nNow when someone requests a quote, AI can either pull from an exact match or work out that their vehicle is similar size to another in the database. I can provide ballpark quotes in minutes that are pretty much bang-on to what the wrapper would quote themselves.\n\nI've noticed a drastic increase in responses from potential leads coming back saying, \"Can you do it in this colour or that colour? How long will it take? When is the earliest you could fit me in?\" All the questions that are edging closer to a deal.\n\n Right now I get 10% of every closed deal.\n\n**Main performer:**\n\n* A car security landing page, took 5 months to build up to \\~£30k/month revenue\n* I take 15% commission = £4.5k monthly income\n* Spend £1k a month on Google Ads for this campaign\n* Getting more and more leads from LLMs like ChatGPT and Perplexity\n\n**The irony:**\n\nMy main business is actually building landing pages for others, but here I am, having become my own best customer - using landing pages to test and drive leads. I can't even fathom how many clients I would need to get to £4.5k a month versus doing the same amount from one landing page.\n\nSometimes the biggest barrier to testing a business idea isn't the market, it's convincing yourself you need all the infrastructure first.\n\nA well-crafted landing page lets you validate demand and understand your market. Then you can decide, do you actually want to do this physical business, or just let someone else do it.\n\n[Testing my car wrapping landing page](https://preview.redd.it/g3n8mnkavppf1.png?width=3133&format=png&auto=webp&s=a488e20a61b0a71bfd4ece24d31dd49052ff2fd5)\n\n",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result.

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m pretty new to the freelance game (Indian doing video editing for overseas clients). I just had a US client file a chargeback after I had delivered everything - payment just got yanked back. 😩\n\nI’m shocked at how easy it was for them to do this.\n\nHow do you protect yourself from this kind of thing? Do you use contracts, milestone payments, special payment platforms, or just trust the client?\n\nAlso - is this common when working with international clients, or did I just get unlucky?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences - I’m trying to figure out if this is just part of the game or if I need to change how I operate. Is there any fixes for this? How long does filling a dispute request take? Do you guys often end up winning these disputes?",
