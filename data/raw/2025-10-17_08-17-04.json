        "selftext": "I need some perspective here: I run a small landscaping company, been doing it for about 4 years now. Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing? Do I just roll with it or am I overthinking this",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I just wanted to share my thoughts. Later, it turned into a tool for building my reputation, and now I’m not even sure: am I running LinkedIn, or is LinkedIn running me? :)\n\nToday, I’ve gathered some numbers, results, and fun facts, and answered some of my followers’ questions.\n\nDo recruiters and HR people reach out? No, not really. And that was my plan. Here’s why: I’m not job-hunting and don’t position myself as a candidate. I’m building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I’m overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my “strategy” will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I’m not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I’ve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn’t my goal, though.\n\nI didn’t expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I’m satisfied :)\n\nI’ve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it. I’m grateful to the people who read me. It makes me happy, and I encourage everyone who enjoys writing to just keep doing it, even if your reach isn’t impressive yet.",
