        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from Rebelgrowth\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
