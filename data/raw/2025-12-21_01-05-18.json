        "selftext": "Most founders think building the product is 70% of the work. I thought the same until I shipped my MVP and realized... it's actually the opposite. Building is maybe 30%. The other 70%? Getting people to actually use it.\n\nI'm a technical founder. I'd rather write code than cold DMs. But here's what I learned getting[ my SEO tool](https://blogseo.io) to $2k MRR ([Proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/muuqq6bh))\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nI messaged everyone I knew – ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, random people I'd met at events. But instead of pitching directly, I asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo things happen:\n\nIf they're interested, they say \"yeah, me actually\"\n\nIf not, they might intro you to someone\n\nYou win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell.\n\n**2. Posting consistently**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing fancy. Just sharing what I was building and learning. Multiple people DM'd me asking about the product who became paying customers.\n\nThe compounding effect is real, even if your posts only get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email**\n\nHonestly, this didn't work great at first because my sequence sucked. But here's what I learned: spend 80% of your time on targeting the RIGHT people (nail your ICP), 20% on the copy.\n\nLater I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly – much higher leverage.\n\n**4. SEO**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks, pages started ranking and I got traffic from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most people miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pulling from web content too. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of searchers.\n\nBlogSEO handles both the content generation AND has a backlink exchange network now; it's basically full-stack SEO automation.\n\nOne of my users reached 450+ clicks a day without doing anything, it's pretty wild. ([Proof](https://imgur.com/a/gnlkuYF))\n\n**5. Small ad spend**\n\nOnly did this AFTER I had organic conversions. Ads amplify what's already working – they won't fix a broken funnel.\n\nEven people who didn't buy gave me their email. That list became valuable later.\n\n**6. Obsessing over first customers**\n\nTreated my first 10 customers like they were paying me $10k/month. Jumped on calls. Fixed bugs same-day. Asked for feedback constantly.\n\nResult? They became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies. One review on my signup page increased conversions 50%.\n\n**7. Affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. Made it dead simple to join from inside the app. Then reached out to people who build websites for clients – natural upsell for them since their clients need traffic after the site is built.\n\nOne good affiliate = ongoing customer stream, not just one sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nLaunched on \"There's an AI for That\" – got a nice traffic spike. Lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug though (painful lesson: test your critical flows obsessively). Next on the list is ProductHunt.\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. These tactics aren't sexy. None of them went viral. But they compound.\n\nWhile everyone's chasing the next Twitter thread strategy, you can quietly stack Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\n**TL;DR**: DM people you know (ask for intros, not sales), post consistently, cold email affiliates not just customers, automate SEO early, run small ad tests only after organic works, obsess over early customers, launch on directories.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's stuck on a specific tactic.",

Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post.

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
