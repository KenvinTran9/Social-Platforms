        "selftext": "I’m a small business owner and professional dog groomer. I recently bought a high-end professional high-velocity dryer for about $760. After receiving it, I had some first-impression concerns and reached out to the company to talk through them and possibly return it.\n\nInstead of troubleshooting or pushing back at all, they immediately refunded me in full and told me to keep the unit. No discussion. Just “refund processed, you don’t need to send it back.”\n\nHere’s the unexpected part: after actually using it under real workload, the thing is phenomenal. Faster dry times, insane airflow, doesn’t bog down under resistance. It’s objectively better than some legacy brands I’ve used for years and clearly a serious professional tool with solid internals.\n\nAnother detail: this was the last unit they had available directly. All distributors I checked are quoting 5 to 6 week lead times on new stock.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with a $760 piece of equipment that I didn’t pay for, is actively improving my day-to-day operations, and would easily pay for itself many times over. I didn’t ask for a comp, didn’t threaten a chargeback, didn’t exaggerate issues. I genuinely just wanted to talk through concerns and possibly return it.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, the whole situation feels… weird. Objectively, it’s a win. But it also feels morally awkward because that wasn’t my intent, and I know what margins can look like for smaller manufacturers.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen where the outcome is great, but it still feels uncomfortable? Or is this just one of those “accept the good luck and move on” situations?",

The whole performative productivity thing. And I was miserable and the business wasn't even growing that fast.\n\nThe breaking point was a Thursday afternoon when I sat at my desk for 3 hours and literally couldn't make myself do anything. Just stared at the screen. Brain completely empty. I thought something was medically wrong with me.\n\nTalked to a therapist. She asked me what I did for fun. I couldn't answer. Asked me when I last took a day completely off. Couldn't remember. Asked me if I actually enjoyed running this business. I started crying which was embarrassing but also clarifying.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you. Productivity systems are designed for people who aren't working enough. If you're already working too much, optimizing your work just means you burn out more efficiently.\n\nWhat actually helped was cutting my hours. Not optimizing them. Cutting them. I went from 70 to 45. Felt terrifying at first. Felt like I was abandoning the business. But the business didn't notice. Revenue kept growing at roughly the same rate. Some things just didn't get done and turns out they didn't need to get done.\n\nThe 25 hours I got back went to sleep, exercise, seeing friends, and just existing as a human. My actual productive output during the 45 hours is now higher than it was during the 70. I can think clearly again. I can make decisions. I don't dread Monday anymore.\n\nMore hours isn't more output. It's just more hours.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar?",

It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half.

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.

While I was working locally on my machine, his live website got hacked, so he asked me to recover his old server. I did recover it, but because of the security breach I told him that just fixing a few issues wouldn’t be enough — we needed to upgrade everything.\n\nSo I upgraded his website from **Laravel 5 → Laravel 11** and **Nova 4 → Nova 5**, created **two new servers** (the original also had two for old apps/functions), installed **cPanel**, and updated all systems for security and stability.\n\nAfter that, I continued working on his original project scope and also asked him to open a new milestone for the additional work. Now he is saying that he “doesn’t see progress” and that “nothing works,” even though I’ve completed around **90% of the original scope + new scope**.\n\nThis is happening on Freelancer.com. If he wins the dispute, I might even have to pay an additional **$100**, which is insane. Has anyone dealt with this before? Is it better to delete the work on the two servers or keep everything as is and try my luck with the dispute?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would help.\n\nThanks..",
