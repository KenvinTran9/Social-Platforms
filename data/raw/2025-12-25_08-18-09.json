        "selftext": "Got an email a few months ago. The CEO of my biggest competitor wanted to chat. Assumed it was a trick or a scouting mission. Took the call anyway out of curiosity. They wanted to buy me. Real offer. Real number. Not life-changing money but meaningful. I didn't take it. But the process of considering it taught me a ton. They asked questions I'd never asked myself. What percentage of customers actually use the core feature? What's the real competitive moat? How replaceable am I personally to the business? What would break if I disappeared? What assets transfer versus what's just me? Had to actually find the answers. Some were uncomfortable. The moat I thought existed basically didn't. Turns out competitors could rebuild my product in 3-4 months. The thing I thought was defensible was just a head start. My personal involvement was more central than I'd admitted. Relationships I had with key customers, knowledge in my head, reputation I'd built. The business without me was worth a lot less than I assumed. But I also discovered strengths I'd undersold. Customer retention was higher than I realized. A segment I thought was small was actually growing fast. The word of mouth in a specific niche was stronger than any marketing I'd done. The acquisition didn't happen but the clarity was worth more than the offer. Highly recommend pretending someone wants to buy you and asking yourself the hard questions. You'll learn a lot. What would you discover if someone tried to acquire you?",

I was completely unprepared for the business side of things inventory management, pricing, marketing, dealing with suppliers.\nThe jewelry-making part is still enjoyable, but it's now only about twenty percent of my actual work. The rest is answering emails, managing social media, tracking expenses, dealing with shipping issues, and trying to convince people my pieces are worth the prices I'm charging.\nLast week, someone asked why my necklace cost sixty dollars when they saw \"\"similar ones\"\" for ten dollars elsewhere. I tried explaining handmade quality versus mass production, but they just walked away. It's discouraging to have your work undervalued constantly.\nI've been sourcing some materials from Alibaba to keep costs manageable, which helps with margins, but I worry about maintaining quality while staying competitive on price. Finding that balance is exhausting.\nI'm starting to understand why so many small businesses fail in the first year. The romantic idea of being your own boss crashes hard against the reality of uncertain income and constant problem-solving. Some days I miss my old job security. Other days, I'm proud of every sale I make.\n\n",

I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing.
