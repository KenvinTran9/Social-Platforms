        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Instead, there are lots of new Q&A / discussion-based startups appearing, and even older platforms like Reddit feel far more active, relevant, and alive.\n\nIt makes me wonder: what really happened to Quora as a product and company? Did the experience slowly get worse (bots, low-quality answers, clickbait, aggressive ads), or did user behavior simply shift toward faster, community-driven platforms and AI tools?\n\nFrom a startup point of view, I’m fascinated by how a small team can compete with – and sometimes beat – a big, established player. With fewer resources but more focus, a startup can ship faster, keep the UX clean, moderate better, and stay closer to what users want *right now*, not what worked 10 years ago.\n\nFor founders and PMs here:\n\n* If you were building in the “Quora space” today, what would you do differently?\n* What do you think Quora got wrong (or stopped doing right)?\n* Are Q&A platforms still a good problem space in 2025, or is that window mostly closed?\n\n(For clarity: I’m not promoting anything, just trying to understand the dynamics and learn from Quora’s trajectory.)",

        "selftext": "Feeling defeated and I need advice from freelancers who've figured this out.\n\nClient hired me for a landing page: $2,000 for 20 hours of work (my rate is $100/hr).\n\nThen the extras started:\n\n\\- \"Can you add a blog section?\" (+10 hours)\n\n\\- \"Actually let's change the entire color scheme\" (+8 hours)\n\n\\- \"One more revision on the copy\" (+5 hours)\n\n\n\nI kept saying yes because I didn't want to lose the client or get a bad review.\n\nFinal tally: 43 hours worked, $2,000 paid.\n\nThat's $2,300 in unpaid work (23 hours × my $100/hr rate).\n\n\n\nFor those who've cracked this - what's your system?\n\n\n\nDo you:\n\n\\- Invoice immediately for every change request?\n\n\\- Have contracts tight enough to prevent this?\n\n\\- Just say no and risk the relationship?\n\n\\- Something else I'm missing?\n\n\n\nI can't keep doing this. Next project I need a better approach.\n\nAny advice appreciated.",
