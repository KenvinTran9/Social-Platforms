        "selftext": "For a while now we have been removing \"pain points\" market research posts under certain circumstances. We are going to be expanding this rule because of the continuous onslaught of people trying to use our subscribers as an unpaid market research group. That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

A few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic about the field, but I have reached a point where this life no longer satisfies me. You are probably wondering why... Well, a year and a half ago, I met the woman who represents me, the kind of woman I dreamed of being with, and going on voyages has become increasingly difficult. I work one month on a ship and one month at home, and I get paid 100% of the same salary for both months. At work, I started to experience anxiety and racism. I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home. The food is very bad, I always have stomach problems, and I always miss home and my loved ones. For now, I have an emergency fund that will cover my expenses for about 8 months. My goal is to reach an amount that will cover 24 months of expenses and then focus on trading and another business I want to start with my girlfriend. I thought about saving some money in addition to the emergency fund for any unforeseen circumstances in the coming year. What do you think? Am I being realistic about what I want to do? Next year, I want to start that business and gradually give up my job. Do you think it's a good idea to quit even if it doesn't pay as much as my current job, even though I have my savings?",

He spent like 2 hours tracking people down in slack asking about random charges from weeks ago that nobody remembers. The day after I had lunch with him and he looked pretty sad and he (I didn't brought it up) brought up how it's super hard to deal with the expenses in our company since nobody is responsible\n\nThe worst part is he's genuinely a great guy and I feel terrible watching people take advantage of how nice he is. He'll never push back or enforce consequences so everyone knows they can just submit whenever and he'll deal with it\n\nI know there's nothing from my side that I can do about this but I just want to know if I can propose something to him in order to fix this. I'm also planning to talk to some of our coworkers and ask them to be more responsible because they're literally adults WITH KIDS who are doing this.
