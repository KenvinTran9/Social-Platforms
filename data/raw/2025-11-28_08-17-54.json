I see the lifestyle up close. The cars, the casual spending, the confidence, but I don’t know how they got there. And it makes me wonder what their starting point looked like.\n\nSo I want to ask the people here who actually lived it. If you grew up poor and became rich, what did you specifically do to get there?\nWhat steps did you take, what choices mattered most, and how did you break out of the cycle when you didn’t have money, connections, or a safety net?\n\nI’m not looking for generic answers like “just work hard.” I mean the real, practical path you took. Especially during those early years when you were broke and everything felt impossible.\n\nThanks to anyone willing to share. I really appreciate it.",

Why?\" Me: \"Because if you do, you should DIY it.

My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them. That's potentially lost revenue. Am I building a sustainable business or just being naive for saying the truth that actually helps?

The problem is that the author is often just looking for engagement and never actually sends the promised book or answer.\n\nI found a way to take advantage of these posts to extract leads and get crazy results in my outreach.   \n  \nStep 1: Find a post with tons of engagement in your niche. If the author isn’t replying to comments, that’s a good sign, go for it.  \n  \nStep 2: Extract everyone who liked or commented. You can do it with a tool.   \n  \nStep 3: Send them a LinkedIn message and an email saying: “I saw you commented on a post to receive a resource about (topic). Did you get it?”  \n  \nThey’ll say no, and then you simply send them your own guide.  \n  \nI started doing this a few days ago and I’ve never seen better results in cold outreach.  \n  \nGood luck, and go get them!\n\nI made a video showing exactly how to do this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmJH8nCeeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmJH8nCeeM)",
