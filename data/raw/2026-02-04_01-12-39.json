        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend.

Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",

        "selftext": "I've been a software engineer for over two decades. I've built products for other people; telecom, banks, medical software. I watched colleagues launch startups in their 20s. And I always thought \"maybe next year.\"\n\nLast month, I finally stopped thinking and shipped Allscreenshots.com - a screenshot API for developers.\n\nHere's what 30 days taught me that 20 years of building software didn't:\n\n**The thing that almost killed me:**\n\nI spent months building. Perfecting the cookie banner detection. Rewriting the SDK three times until it felt right.\n\nYou know what I didn't do? Tell anyone it existed.\n\nMarketing felt scary. Building felt safe, something I know I can do. I could hide behind my code and convince myself I was \"making progress.\"\n\nThe truth? I was avoiding the hard part. Putting myself out there. Risking rejection. Having someone look at my work and say \"this isn't for me.\"\n\nFor a 46-year-old with two decades of experience, this is embarrassing to admit. But it's the trap I fell into, and I suspect a lot of developers here are in it too.\n\n**What changed everything:**\n\nSomeone recommended \"Traction\" by Gabriel Weinberg. I finished it in 2 days while on a holiday. The core idea hit me hard: you should spend 50% of your time on product and 50% on traction. Not 95/5. Not \"marketing comes later.\" Half and half, from day one.\n\nBefore this, I was doing maybe 98% product, 2% traction. And that 2% was mostly tweeting into the void.\n\nSo I forced myself to flip. For every hour coding, an hour on outreach, content, or talking to potential customers.\n\nIt felt wrong at first. Like I was neglecting the product. But here's what happened: the conversations I started having actually made the product better. I learned what people cared about, not what I assumed they cared about.\n\nThe cookie banner detection I spent weeks perfecting? Users expect it to just work. They don't care how. The features I almost didn't build because they seemed boring? Those are the ones people actually mention.\n\n**For anyone over 40 reading this:**\n\nThe common wisdom is that startups are a young person's game. You need the energy, the risk tolerance, the runway.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: at 45+, you have something better than energy. You have pattern recognition. You've seen enough projects succeed and fail to know which work actually matters.\n\nMy problem wasn't lack of skills. It was hiding behind the skills I had to avoid the skills I didn't.\n\nBuilding is comfortable. Marketing is vulnerable. At 46, I finally stopped hiding.\n\nIf you're a developer sitting on a product you haven't shown anyone yet: the code isn't what's holding you back. The fear is. And every day you spend \"perfecting\" instead of shipping is another day you're letting that fear win.\n\nRead Traction. Apply the 50/50 rule. Ship the thing.\n\nCurious what we're building?
