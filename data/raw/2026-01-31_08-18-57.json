        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "title": "We sold our SaaS startup for $15M in 18 months. Here's exactly how we did it.",
        "selftext": "I'm a PM at [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) now, but before this I was the founding engineer at a startup that sold for $15M in 18 months. Sharing bc I think this is relevant for founders here.\n\nThe founders had been running this playbook for years. One had 8 successful exits, the other had 3. When they hired me, they told me exactly how it would go. I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as they said.\n\nHere's the playbook:\n\n**Step 1: Pick a legacy industry (this is the most important step)**\n\nFind an industry as far from Silicon Valley as possible. The key criteria: customers and competitors should not be able to build anything themselves. Ideally, you or your co founder has domain expertise. If you don't, find a co founder who does\n\nWe sold to benefits brokers, the people who handle 401(k)s and HSAs. Other good verticals: oil and gas, medical SaaS, logistics, construction tech.\n\nWhat to avoid: anything where your customers are technical. Dev tools would be a terrible choice. If your buyer can look at your product and think \"I could build this,\" you're in the wrong market.\n\n**Step 2: Build a product and raise money, but not for the reasons you think**\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: the product doesn't have to be great. You shouldn't waste too much time making it perfect. The product is the least important part of this playbook.\n\nWhat matters is legitimacy & credibility. Raising money signals to people in these industries that you're a real company, not two people in a garage. Most people in legacy industries don't know Sequoia from some random angel syndicate, so don't waste time chasing name-brand VCs. Just raise around $1M and move on.\n\nHiring a few people also helps. It makes you look like a \"real\" company. The whole point here is building trust and brand recognition within the industry.\n\n**Step 3: Sign design partnerships with potential acquirers**\n\nI know most people on the internet advise against design partnerships, but for this playbook they're essential, with one critical caveat: your design partners need to be companies that could eventually acquire you.\n\nWe partnered with 4 big names in the employee benefits space. If you can, get them to invest in your company. Give their CEOs board seats. You're not optimizing for product feedback here. You're optimizing for relationships and positioning.\n\n**Step 4: Build deep rapport over 12+ months**\n\nThis is the step that takes the longest, but it's what makes everything else work.\n\nOur CEO was talking to all 4 design partner CEOs on a weekly basis. You need to understand what initiatives they have going on, what they care about, what keeps them up at night. You need to become a trusted advisor, someone they see as a technology expert who actually understands their space.\n\nIf these companies have subsidiaries, start meeting with them too. Cast a wide net within the org.\n\nWhile this is happening, you can talk to other customers and generate some revenue, but honestly, revenue is the least important metric in this playbook.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the opportunity**\n\nIf you've done steps 1 through 4 correctly, this part is actually easy.\n\nIn our case, one of our design partners had a subsidiary that grew rapidly. They suddenly needed an AI solution to handle some stuff around the benefits they were selling. What they needed was adjacent to our product, but not exactly what we built.\n\nThis is the sweet spot. They had a problem. We had the team, the trust, and enough product to be credible.\n\nInstead of offering to build them a feature, we offered to sell them the whole company. If you can create this dynamic with multiple design partners at once, even better. Deal heat is real.\n\n**Step 6: Close**\n\nCall it an acqui-hire, call it a quick sale, whatever. Close the deal.\n\nYou'll probably need to stay on afterward to build the solution you discussed, but that's fine. You just sold your company for 8 figures.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Go into a narrow legacy industry where buyers can't build\n2. Build credibility as a tech expert and domain expert\n3. Sign design partners who could be acquirers\n4. Build deep rapport over 12+ months\n5. Identify an adjacent opportunity\n6. Sell the company, not a feature\n\nI know this seems counterintuitive. This playbook basically does everything most people online advise against. Don't obsess over product. Don't focus on revenue. Do design partnerships. Optimize for relationships over growth.\n\nIf you're trying to build a billion dollar company, this is NOT the playbook for you. Many people here are swinging for that, and that's great. But if you want a low 8-figure exit in under 2 years, this works. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

        "selftext": "When I was choosing an automation tool for my outreach nobody told me exactly why automation is risky, so I decided to share what I figured out testing different outreach tools\n\n\n\n1. One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for the tool for a long term.\n4. Can it connect to your CRM without making things worse\n5. Will support actually help if LinkedIn sends you a warning\n\n\n\nWhat else should be on here?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Wow.\n\nDidn't think this would happen so fast. We had a (former) employee record conversations without anyone's knowledge or approval and plug them all into an LLM.  It started at \"organizing my thoughts\" and ended with \"listen to this conversation and tell me how to manipulate my coworkers\". To top it off we are in the defense space and this person occasionally handled CUI/EAR information. Luckily no evidence they ever input that information into ChatGPT.\n\nIt was all sorts of conversations, normal business meetings, customer conversations, HR meetings. Sensitive topics. We're in a 2 party consent state for recordings this has been a huge and expensive nightmare. Civil, Criminal and ITAR lawyers had to weigh in. I've never seen this in my career.\n\nIf you don't have an AI policy in your handbook add one now! ChatGPT logs aren't confidential. Don't wait until someone thought they were doing you a favor by uploading all your IP to a 3rd party on a personal account.",
