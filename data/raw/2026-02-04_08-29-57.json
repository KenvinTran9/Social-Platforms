        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "I've been a software engineer for over two decades. I've built products for other people; telecom, banks, medical software. I watched colleagues launch startups in their 20s. And I always thought \"maybe next year.\"\n\nLast month, I finally stopped thinking and shipped Allscreenshots.com - a screenshot API for developers.\n\nHere's what 30 days taught me that 20 years of building software didn't:\n\n**The thing that almost killed me:**\n\nI spent months building. Perfecting the cookie banner detection. Rewriting the SDK three times until it felt right.\n\nYou know what I didn't do? Tell anyone it existed.\n\nMarketing felt scary. Building felt safe, something I know I can do. I could hide behind my code and convince myself I was \"making progress.\"\n\nThe truth? I was avoiding the hard part. Putting myself out there. Risking rejection. Having someone look at my work and say \"this isn't for me.\"\n\nFor a 46-year-old with two decades of experience, this is embarrassing to admit. But it's the trap I fell into, and I suspect a lot of developers here are in it too.\n\n**What changed everything:**\n\nSomeone recommended \"Traction\" by Gabriel Weinberg. I finished it in 2 days while on a holiday. The core idea hit me hard: you should spend 50% of your time on product and 50% on traction. Not 95/5. Not \"marketing comes later.\" Half and half, from day one.\n\nBefore this, I was doing maybe 98% product, 2% traction. And that 2% was mostly tweeting into the void.\n\nSo I forced myself to flip. For every hour coding, an hour on outreach, content, or talking to potential customers.\n\nIt felt wrong at first. Like I was neglecting the product. But here's what happened: the conversations I started having actually made the product better. I learned what people cared about, not what I assumed they cared about.\n\nThe cookie banner detection I spent weeks perfecting? Users expect it to just work. They don't care how. The features I almost didn't build because they seemed boring? Those are the ones people actually mention.\n\n**For anyone over 40 reading this:**\n\nThe common wisdom is that startups are a young person's game. You need the energy, the risk tolerance, the runway.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: at 45+, you have something better than energy. You have pattern recognition. You've seen enough projects succeed and fail to know which work actually matters.\n\nMy problem wasn't lack of skills. It was hiding behind the skills I had to avoid the skills I didn't.\n\nBuilding is comfortable. Marketing is vulnerable. At 46, I finally stopped hiding.\n\nIf you're a developer sitting on a product you haven't shown anyone yet: the code isn't what's holding you back. The fear is. And every day you spend \"perfecting\" instead of shipping is another day you're letting that fear win.\n\nRead Traction. Apply the 50/50 rule. Ship the thing.\n\nCurious what we're building?

Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

        "selftext": "I just spent my entire Sunday filming Instagram reels and I'm losing my mind.\n\nFreelance brand designer, three years in. Work is fine. But somehow I became a content creator along the way and I don't remember signing up for that.\n\nI spend 6-8 hours a week shooting reels for Instagram because apparently that's how you get discovered now. Writing LinkedIn posts about random design tips because the algorithm buries you if you don't post. Filming TikToks in my living room at night because that's the only time left after actual client work.\n\nNone of this makes me money. It's all \"visibility\" and \"building your brand.\" Fine, whatever. But I'm exhausted.\n\nTried hiring someone but quotes were $800-1200 a month. Tried posting less but inquiries dropped by half. Had two potential clients ghost me after checking my Instagram. One of them straight up said it looked \"dead.\"\n\nNow I'm working 50 hour weeks but only 35 are billable. I see other freelancers posting constantly looking put together. How? Either I'm broken at this or everyone's just hiding it better.\n\nStarting to think I should just get a regular job where I can actually log off.\n\nTrying out a few AI tools to cut down filming time. APOB for generating video content, Canva for captions, and Descript for audio. Early days but seems like it might save 2-3 hours a week. Output feels kind of generic though. Videos look a bit too polished in a fake way and captions need heavy editing. Not sure if this is actually solving anything or just trading one problem for another.\n\nAlso going to try batch filming this weekend. We'll see.\n\nStill feels like I'm just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here.",
