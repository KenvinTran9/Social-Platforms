It’s not even about trust it’s just realizing how fast something you built from scratch can get tangled up in stuff that has nothing to do with work.   \nI’m in a serious relationship now and things are good, but for the first time, I’ve actually caught myself thinking about stuff like prenups or protecting ownership. Never thought I’d be that person, but here we are.\n\nAny other business owners hit that point where you start looking at marriage a little differently once there’s a company involved?",

        "selftext": "So this company reached out to me about a freelance project. The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement! ",

Anyone claiming otherwise is lying in plain sight, and I am sick of reading about these lies every now and then.\n\nSure, tools make building easier: AI, \"vibe coding\" and so on.\n\nBut that's exactly what’s killing startups. It's now almost impossible to build a moat. Every product-market fit (difficult per se to find in a solutions over-saturated world) turns into a red ocean in the blink of an eye.\n\nBefore you even manage to build an MVP and get early traction, ten other ventures are already doing the same thing - burning money and making any roadmap to profitability useless.\n\nThe only remaining way to build a moat is through distribution (and distribution only, while it used to be a mix) - and that’s the most plutocratic asset of all. Those who already have customers have money, and those with money can afford to lose more of it, for longer, even in a red ocean.\n\nTo some extent, this has always been true. But now it's 10x, maybe 100x worse.\n\nNewcomers’ efforts are fragmented; they never reach the critical mass to become something meaningful. In the best-case scenario, they get acquired early by incumbents just to speed up existing processes - so nobody really profits from the initial risk.\n\nAs a \"job\" when you weigh risks and opportunities, building startups is becoming less and less viable.\n\nIs that a sterile complaint? Yes.\n\nIs it wrong? You tell me.",

        "selftext": "\nSo back when I was in my sophomore year, I got this idea to start a small clothing brand. I was broke, drowning in assignments & honestly thought it’d be a fun way to make a little money in college\n\nThe idea was to do retro sports-wear, kinda like those 90s oversized tees with old school fonts and colors. I sketched out a few designs, made a logo on Canva *(yeah I know, rookie move)* & thought I was ready to build a brand overnight 😭\n\nAt first I tried finding local printers but everything was way too expensive. Minimum orders were like 50 shirts and I had no clue if anyone would even buy them. So I started small with print on demand just to test the waters. My friends ordered a few and wore them around campus which actually gave me some confidence\n\nThe hard part wasn’t design, it was figuring out how to get people to care. Marketing was way harder than I expected. I made an Insta page, got like 100 followers, then hit a wall. I didn’t have time to post daily or run ads, and I didn’t wanna beg friends to buy stuff\n\nAfter a few months I basically ran out of steam. I sold maybe 20 shirts total. Nothing crazy but it was fun seeing something I made actually out there in the world\n\nLooking back now, I realize I rushed into it without a real plan. I should’ve done more research on brand positioning and maybe tested more designs before launching\n\nIf any of you have done something similar, what would you have done differently? Like, if you were starting a clothing brand in college today, how would you go about it?",

        "selftext": "What's up everyone\n\nSo I've been lurking here forever seeing all these \"how do I monetize AI\" posts and I finally have something that's actually working. Not some get-rich-quick thing but like... actual recurring revenue.\n\nBasically I built a voice bot that answers phones for dental offices using ElevenLabs and n8n. Sounds boring but hear me out.\n\nThe whole idea came from my dentist's office constantly missing calls when they're busy. I was like... why isn't this automated yet? So I just built it.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAnswers calls 24/7, books appointments, answers the basic stuff like office hours and insurance questions, and passes the complicated calls to real people. That's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nStack is super simple - ElevenLabs API for the voice (seriously their voices are insanely good now), n8n to connect everything together, and it hooks into their calendar system.\n\nWhat actually worked\n\nStarted with literally one clinic. Didn't even charge them much at first, just wanted to see if it actually worked in the real world. Spent like a full day just sitting at their front desk watching what they do.\n\nThe voice thing is weirdly important. My first version sounded like a corporate robot and people hated it. Made it sound more friendly and casual and suddenly everyone was fine with it.\n\nYou HAVE to let people bail to a human. I added a \"press 0 anytime\" thing and it made all the difference. Some people just aren't gonna talk to a bot and that's cool.\n\nHonestly the biggest lesson was don't try to make it do everything. It handles the boring repetitive calls and that's enough. The staff handles the rest.\n\nWhere I'm at now\n\nStarted in August with that one clinic, now I've got 4. Charging like $500-800 to set it up then $200-400 a month depending on call volume. Making around $1400/month right now which isn't crazy but it's growing.\n\nBest moment was when one of the office managers told me her team can actually eat lunch now without stressing about phones. Made the whole thing feel worth it honestly.\n\nNot gonna lie my first launch was a disaster lmao. It double booked a bunch of appointments because I messed up the calendar integration. But you figure it out.\n\nIf you wanna try this\n\nJust find one local business with a phone problem. Dentists, hair salons, lawyers, whatever. Build something simple that solves ONE annoying thing they deal with every day.\n\nDon't overthink it. My whole setup runs on like $50/month in costs and took me maybe 2 weeks to build the first version.\n\nAnyway hope this helps someone. Happy to answer stuff if you have questions",

        "selftext": "hey guys,\ni’ve been working as a developer for 10 years and building indie products for the past 2. i’ve launched more than 10 projects and had 2 exits so far. but every time i started, developed, or tried to distribute a new product, i kept running into the same problem: tools that were either overpriced or simply didn’t work well in my country (like stripe, for example).\n\nwhenever i needed an alternative to something, i would lose hours searching and bookmarking random indie tools i saw on twitter or reddit. later, i’d spend even more time analyzing them one by one.\n\nso i built [AlterBase](https://alterbase.co) to solve my own problem. and hopefully help others who struggle to find good, affordable alternatives just like me.\n\nright now it’s still an early with a small number of tools, but i’m going to add minimum 30-40 tools every day. my goal is to make it the biggest alternative software platform on the internet.\n\nsure, there are sites like alternative(to) or alternative(me), but they use outdated databases and old designs. and it makes hard to find usable tools. alterbase only lists handpicked tools that are actually useful.\n\nadding your product is free. if you’ve built an alternative to a big or expensive tool, or want to suggest one, you can already list it and claim your spot early.\n\nwould love to hear your feedback if you give it a try.\n",
