We applied for [our new SAAS. ](https://gojiberry.ai)  \n  \nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\n  \nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch. \n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

Enough to see value, not enough to fully solve the problem.\nAdded friction to free signup. Required work email, brief survey about use case.\nFocused marketing on buyer personas, not general awareness.\nMeasured success by paid customers, not total users.\nNew results:\nTotal users: dropped to 400\nPaying customers: 41\nFree-to-paid conversion: 8.7%\nSupport load: down 60%\nRevenue: up despite fewer users\nQuality beats quantity.\nWould rather have 400 serious users than 1,000 tire-kickers.\nWhat's your free-to-paid conversion rate?\n",

        "selftext": "I own a candy/snack store, with a concentration on imports.. but plenty of penny candies available for stocking stuffers.\n\nNo matter what I have done for advertising, including all social media and paying for it... I have been down a lot for November and December. I am talking October to November, a $2,000 drop month to month. And December has been trending even worse than November.\n\nI am not sure what is going on. My ratings are 5 stars, customer service has been great according to others, variety is good, and I have been doing a fundraiser to get the community gifts for their kids, helping over 15 families with getting their gifts this Holiday season.\n\nI am fairly upset as I was counting on November and December to be my \"stashing\" months so I could carry through January and February. I am barely able to keep the doors open right now and am scared at what is going to happen when January and February hits.\n\nI forgot to mention originally, but am located in Central Wisconsin, in the United States.",
