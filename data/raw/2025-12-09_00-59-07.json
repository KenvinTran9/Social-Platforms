It’s been a grind but we actually hit some MRR that might get us semiprofitable soon.\n\nAnyway, last few weeks he’s been getting weird about \"ownership\". Keeps saying stuff like \"I feel like an employee in my own startup\". Which… idk, maybe sorta fair? He’s at 35% equity. But I’ve been the one doing all the fundraising, sales, ops, support, marketing, you name it.\n\nThis morning I wake up to 47 Slack messages. He rage quit last night, forked the entire repo to his personal GitHub, and sent an email to a few of our paying customers saying he’s the real founder and that he’s \"starting fresh without the baggage\". Then he deleted himself from our Slack.\n\nOur dev team is freaking out. Investors are texting me \"wtf happened?\" and I’m somewhere between panic and laughter at this point.\n\nAnyway, lawyers are now involved.. Has anyone else ever had a cofounder go nuclear like this? Is there any coming back from this, or is it just scorched earth and move on?\n\nPosting from a throwaway account here... sorry guys. I'm actually quite active on my regular account and I think I've seen a eerily similar story here a while back (an omen?) but I can't seem to find it anymore to see what the advice was.",

        "selftext": "I run a small business in Australia. Stripe is keeping $7,946 of my money permanently. When I posted about it on r/stripe, it hit 16,000 views within hours. Then the mods removed it. Screenshots attached.\n\nThis is what happened.\n\nA client paid me $5,500 USD for completed AI development work. Stripe refuses to release it. Their justification: a completely unrelated $50 dispute from a random person. That dispute is already resolved. The person got their refund weeks ago. Case closed.\n\nDespite that, Stripe is using this resolved $50 dispute to hold nearly $8,000 that has nothing to do with it.\n\nKey facts:\n\n• I passed all verification requirements. Identity, documents, compliance checks. Dashboard showed all tasks completed.\n\n• Stripe froze my account the day before the payout was scheduled. Not during any investigation. They waited until the last moment.\n\n• Stripe claimed they would refund money to customers within five days. My client confirmed they received nothing. Stripe kept the funds.\n\n• My client provided a signed statement confirming the payment was legitimate, the work was delivered, and no dispute will ever be filed. Stripe ignored it.\n\n• All communication from Stripe is a copy-paste response: “high risk.” No explanation, no evidence, no path to resolution.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nDisputed amount: $50\nAmount Stripe is keeping: $7,946\nRatio: 160 times the disputed amount\nThe dispute is from a different customer and is already resolved.\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n\n• Complaint filed with Stripe. Their final answer: “We’re keeping your money.”\n• Complaint filed with AFCA (Australian Financial Complaints Authority). Case number: 12-25-334332\n• Final Notice filed in SA Magistrates Court. Case number: FNL-25-010285\n• Report filed with ACCC for unconscionable conduct. Reference: accc-report:0098524\n• Posted on r/stripe. Removed after going semi-viral. Screenshots attached.\n\nI followed every rule. Verified identity. Provided documentation. Delivered the work. My client is happy. Stripe decided to keep the money anyway.\n\nIf Stripe can withhold funds arbitrarily, ignore evidence, and silence criticism, every small business is at risk.\n\nSharing this so others understand the danger before relying on Stripe.",

I’m like cool man, that’s my comfort zone. easy money, quick turnaround, nothing too deep.\n\nthen he drops a google doc on me. and I’m not kidding, it looked like someone took a whatsapp rant, a horoscope prediction, a product description, shook it all together, and dumped it in one file. some lines were all caps like he was yelling at future customers. some lines were like “pls insert something that builds emotional buy-in.” bro what emotional buy-in?? from where?? like I gotta generate emotions from thin air now??\n\nand then he kept messaging every 20 minutes — “quick call?” “jump for 2 mins?” “just align energy?” (yes he actually said that once). like dude let ME work, pls. I’ve never seen someone interrupt the work they desperately want done.\n\nthe best part though… the voice notes. whispering. literally whispering like some netflix thriller villain. “make the button more… urgent.” in slow motion. I had my headphones on and jumped out of my chair because WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT. I started wondering if this is some kind of psychological tactic or if he just genuinely talks like a broken podcast microphone.\n\nanyway I still finished the page… cleaned his chaotic copy as much as possible, fixed the flow, made it look like an actual landing page that a real human might click. I send it proudly thinking ok he’ll at least appreciate the rescue mission I did on his content.\n\nhe replies:  \n“hmm not feeling the vibe, can you make it more… green?”  \nthat’s it. no explanation. no screenshot. no “this section” or “this element.” just… green. the whole universe?? the entire landing page?? the vibe?? the soul?? I genuinely sat there staring at my screen like alright cool, this is the moment freelancing breaks me.\n\nand honestly the takeaway from this whole chaos — and I’m saying this after many similar incidents — is that weird energy in the first message is NOT a red flag… it’s a preview. and if the preview is confusing, the actual project will be 10x more confusing. but also, these clients accidentally teach you boundaries. like next time I’m setting expectations, charging extra for vague instructions, and asking for proper content BEFORE touching anything.\n\nalso maybe… just maybe… no more clients who whisper in voice notes. I deserve peace in my ears lol.",

        "selftext": "I see linkedin with full of people on Stealth mode. Why? Unless you are famous who cares? If you are that afraid of revealing your idea. Why even mention it as stealth? Just keep it to yourself until have courage to show it. \n\nAre people that paranoid of getting their idea stolen? Google knew about LLMs but didn’t build it until ChatGPT. Apple had billions to build AI but build a garbage Siri. \n\nCopy cats exist but if you are not loudest in room. Who cares? \n\nEdit: I have seen some VC who use stealth. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
