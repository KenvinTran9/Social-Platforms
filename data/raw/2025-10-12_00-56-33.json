It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop and low efort podcasts and generally there is a fear of income loss for any production.\n\nCreators spend a ton on production and editing etc and they are losing views and engagement to AI shorts about women washing dishes in the olympics. 4 millions likes that short got. There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus. In this game of high-stakes poker, DJT like to play his cards face-up.",

I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads. I came up with a brand true to me, an awkward autistic woman.\n\nAnd it worked.

Discipline beats motivation.**  \nThere’s no manager, no deadline -  only u  \nMiss a few days, and it all falls apart.\n\n**3. Family matters.**  \nTheir early support made a big difference, even when I was failing constantly.\n\n**4. Manage money like a pessimist.**  \nSome months are great, others are brutal.  \nBuffers keep you sane.\n\n**5. Think in systems, not fads.**  \nUnderstand how things *work*, not just how to copy them.\n\n**6. Be comfortable with risk.**  \nEntrepreneurship is trading comfort for control.  \nYou won’t win every time -  but you’ll always move forward.\n\nCurious -  how long have you been working for yourself?  \nWhat’s the biggest thing that keeps you going?",

I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",
