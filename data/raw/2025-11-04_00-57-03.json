        "selftext": "I mean it. Too many founders are so high on their own idea they spend months and thousands of dollars building a product that solves a problem nobody actually has. Your idea is a worthless assumption until someone who isn't your mom is willing to pay for it.\n\nThe \"gurus\" sell you on hustle and vision. I'm telling you that's how you go broke. Before you hire a dev or write a single line of code, you need to find the truth, not just confirmation.\n\nHere’s how you do it without a dev team.\n\n**1. Nail your one sentence hypothesis.**\n\nForget 50 page business plans. Write this down and stick it on your wall:\n\nMy target customer, [BE SPECIFIC], struggles with [A PAINFUL, SPECIFIC PROBLEM] and would pay to have it solved.\n\nA founder wanted to build a fitness app. Vague. He went to r/Fitness and realized what people actually hated was logging their workouts in confusing apps. His new hypothesis: “Gym goers who are serious about lifting struggle with clunky workout trackers and would pay for a faster, simpler way to log their sets and reps.” See the difference?\n\n**2. Run cheap experiments to prove yourself wrong.**\n\nYour goal here isn't to get a \"yes.\" It's to see if your idea can survive contact with reality.\n\n*   **The Landing Page Test:** Use Carrd or Notion to build a one page site. Don’t talk about features. Talk about the painful problem and the beautiful outcome your solution provides. Add a \"Get Early Access\" button that collects emails. If you can’t get 100 people to give you an email address, you sure as hell won't get them to give you a credit card.\n\n*   **The Manual 'Concierge' Service:** Sell the solution and deliver it yourself by hand. I know a founder who validated a complex B2B automation tool by running the entire service on Google Sheets and a bunch of Zaps for his first ten paying clients. They never knew. They just knew their problem was solved. He didn't build the real software until he had revenue.\n\n*   **The Social Media Smoke Test:** Post about the problem you’re solving on LinkedIn, Twitter, or a relevant subreddit. Don't pitch your product. Just talk about the pain. \"Anyone else hate how long it takes to [do X]?\" The responses will tell you everything. If people don’t even care enough to complain about the problem, they will never pay for a solution.\n\n**3. Read the results like a cold blooded realist.**\n\nLook at the data. A high email signup rate is a good signal. A bunch of people willing to pay you to solve the problem manually is an amazing signal.\n\nSilence is also data. Silence is a \"no.\"\n\nA lack of interest isn't a failure. It’s a cheap lesson. It’s a gift. Pivoting now costs you a weekend. A failed launch after six months of coding will cost you your savings and your sanity.\n\nStop treating your idea like a precious baby. Treat it like a lab rat. Put it through the maze. If it dies, you get another one. That's how you find the one that gets the cheese.\n\nWhat's the most expensive assumption you've ever made building a product?",

It was chaotic because they were chatty and I had to herd them and look out for stragglers. I wasn't used to such a large group. I had 16 complete the tour. The whole day had been stressful so I was distracted and forgot to make sure the first person paid me for the extra 4 people before ending the tour last night. Today I'm texting her for the extra tickets and so far she's not answering. Hoping she will eventually, but what can I do if she doesn't? That's $140. May not seem like much, but I'm just one person and that can pay some bills. ",

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

I like to do this personally to make sure everything is clear and to answer any questions.\n\nI also explained that he would receive a second email where he would need to sign the waiver and other documents. After that, the rental insurance page would appear, clearly marked as optional, and he could choose to decline it.\n\nHe became irritated and said I was not being transparent and that he did not appreciate it. I explained that the insurance is completely optional and that we only offer it because other customers have requested it. It is even mentioned at the beginning of the confirmation email.\n\nHe told me I had ruined his fun and said he felt obligated to buy insurance. I repeated that he did not have to purchase it, but he said, “Well, now I am worried something might happen during my trip,” and then he hung up.\n\nI am honestly confused about how I was not being transparent.

You could see titles such as:\n\n“I’m so happy, I just got my first paying customer! 🙀”\n\n“Just reached $500 MRR after one month of grinding”\n\n“I can’t believe I just reached 1k waitlist” - then promote Reddit tool\n\nAt the onset, you might think that the story is actually real especially of how believable and genuine they make it seem. Often, they make it subtle enough to make it appear like it did actually happen, and they’re just sharing their “small success”. But beware, this is just a marketing tactic. They make up these stories to get your attention and for you to be interested. One major indicator of this “scam” is that along their story they will usually try to insert a link of their startup. Don’t be fooled! And if you’re a founder, don’t ever do this!",
