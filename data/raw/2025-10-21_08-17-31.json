        "selftext": "We operate a horseback riding business. Obviously, this requires physical ability and makes people prone to injury as they are getting on/off horses. Over the past few years, we have had families bring elderly relatives - people in their 80s and 90s, some with very frail bones or broken hips. This is extremely dangerous as they cannot easily get on/off the horse. Some of them are so immobile they cannot even walk from their cars to our staging area let alone get on a horse.\n\nToday we had an elderly fall off the horse and smash her head open.\n\nI want to be able to legally refuse service to people in such a condition. Here is the problem, federal law (Age Discrimination Act of 1975) does not permit us to discriminate based on age or disability. So we are in a gray area here.\n\nI do not want elderly people who are physically immobile to use our service and if they show up I want to be able to legally deny them, but I do not want to violate federal discrimination laws (such as Age Discrimination Act of 1975) and get sued. Are there any out clauses in the law that we can use for denying service based on it being say \"a risk to that person's safety\" or something? Of course I don't know if we are subject to federal age discrimination laws as we are a private company and do not receive federal funding.\n\nDoes anyone know a way around this. I'm thinking if we make a 'safety and risk' policy for ALL customers instead of just elderly that would work. Any info would be appreciated.\n\n  \nWe do have liability waivers customers sign but I still do not want people getting injured.",

She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct.

The interview rounds went well and they sent me all the project materials at the final interview and told me to look it over and send them an estimated price for the whole thing.\n\nTo be honest, I'm still pretty new to the whole freelancing thing so I don't really know how much I should be charging. I've worked as a full-time employee for most of my career so I do have a target salary in mind. I just don't know how that translates to a freelance rate. I looked up so many posts about figuring out my rate and I finally settled on something and let the company know. They said my rate was a lot higher than they expected so I asked them what their budget was. They dodged the question completely so I asked again and said I'm willing to discuss and adjust my rate to accommodate, but I think I'm being ghosted now. I'm kinda sad and slightly embarrassed about it because I really did want to work with them. Did I fuck up and ask for too much? \\~$2k for a 20+ page pitch deck.\n\nEdit to add more info: I'm an illustrator and designer. I draw and create all my design assets myself. 10 yrs of experience\n\nUpdate: They finally responded and said they were looking for something under $1k loll. I declined. For reference, when I was still finishing up college with 0 work experience and no degree yet, smaller companies were offering me $1200+ for similar amounts of work. I honestly don't know why I never specifically asked about the budget. Maybe because I liked this company and knew they paid their full-time employees well so I assumed they were familiar with fair freelance rates too. Oh well, I've learned what to do next time.

        "selftext": "I've been building RAG systems for a year. Made about $50k from three companies.\n\nEveryone on Twitter and Reddit thinks they're going to get rich building a $29/mo saas wrapper. It's a lottery ticket. The real money is in the most boring, obvious problem: companies can't find shit in their own documents.\n\n**What I actually built**\n\nThis wasn't just slapping tools together. It's a production pipeline.\n\n**Ingestion:** Docs are corrupt, APIs fail. I used Temporal to manage the workflow; it handles retries so I don't have to.\n\n**Processing:** Fixed size chunking is garbage. It cuts sentences in half. I used zchunk (ZeroEntropy) to split docs semantically.\n\n**Indexing:** I indexed everything twice in Qdrant. First with zembed-1 (dense, for semantic meaning). Second with FastEmbed SPLADE (sparse, for keywords and acronyms like 'ISO-9001' that dense vectors miss). You need both.\n\n**Retrieval:** This is where demos fail. A query comes in. I hit both indexes, get a wide net of results (top 50). It's a messy list.\n\n**Reranking:** I feed that messy list + query into zerank-1 (ZeroEntropy). This is the most critical step. It re-sorts everything for actual relevance. This one step fixed \\~30% of my bad results.\n\n**Generation:** Only then do I take the new top 3-5 results and feed them to Gemini 2.5 Pro to write the answer with sources.\n\nThe value wasn't the LLM. It was the plumbing. Backend is FastAPI, frontend Next.js. Postgres just runs Temporal.\n\n**How I got clients**\n\nTo be honest, mine came mostly through personal connections. A friend in compliance was drowning in PDFs, I built them something for $8k, and it spread from there to a research company ($19k) and a logistics firm ($23k).\n\nBut the market is so huge, I'm sure you know someone in one of those industries I listed. Just dig. And if you really don't, just find the right person and email them directly. Forget Upwork. Or I am even sure that in this sub you're all better marketers than me. \n\n**The actual opportunity**\n\nEvery mid-size company has 10+ years of documents in SharePoint or network drives. Their search doesn't work. They are paying people high salaries to manually dig through files. You fix that, they pay $20k, $30k, $50k. Per project. It's a real business, not a side project.\n\n**Industries that actually pay**\n\n* Pharma (regulatory docs)\n* Manufacturing (specs, manuals)\n* Law firms (contracts, cases)\n* Logistics (supplier docs)\n* Energy (inspection reports)\n\nBasically anywhere people waste hours in PDFs.\n\n**How you can do the same**\n\nYou don't even need to be that technical. Go make a professional looking site. Pick one of those industries. Anywhere you have connections or understand the space a minimu,. Contact teams. Ask them how they find internal info. Show them the problem and how much time they're wasting. When they say yes, find a freelance developer  hand them this exact pipeline. You pay them $5k, you charge $30k. You manage the client, they build. Do that 3-4 times a month and you have a legit million dollar a year business. \n\n**Reality check**\n\nThis isn't sexy. You won't get hyped on Twitter for it. But companies will pay $20k+ for something that actually functions vs. another \"AI transformation initiative\" that goes nowhere. The stack is figured out. The sales cycle is short if you can demo a working system. Everyone is fighting for $29/mo subscribers on their tiny saas wrappers, while enterprises are sitting there with $50k checks ready for anyone who can solve this one, boring, high value problem. ",
