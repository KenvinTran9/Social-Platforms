Nothing original nothing sticky no defensibility. The only reason any of them make money is because clients are slow to catch on and still pay for tools they don’t actually need.\n\nSaaS isn’t innovative anymore it’s a margin game. Everyone clones each other and slaps on some UI. Switching costs are low and the market is saturated. The only “wins” you see now are people who sell to clueless corporate teams that take months to change vendors. That’s not a strong business model that’s just inertia.\n\nThe crazy part is founders still think this is the golden path. It’s not. SaaS had its decade but the landscape has changed. Distribution matters more than the product. If you don’t own an audience or a channel you’re just building a disposable tool.\n\nPeople hate hearing it but SaaS is already a graveyard. The dumb clients paying invoices every month are the only thing propping it up. Once they wake up the collapse is obvious.\n",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.\n\nI hate this pattern.

        "selftext": "Hey y'all \n\nI wanted to share the (very scrappy) story of how I built a language learning tool that now has hundreds of users - and how Reddit helped me get there.\n\nA year ago, I was watching Star Trek with my (now) wife.\nWe’re a bilingual household, and we kept pausing the video to go over vocabulary - words we clearly didn’t use in everyday life.\n\nI'm a big believer in immersion and repetition for language acquisition.\n\nThat’s when I thought:\n Wow it sure would be great if there was an app that lets me study the vocab needed before we watch something.\n\n\nSo i searched. Nothing.\nAnd like any sane person I decided to build it myself.\n\n- I didn’t know how to code at all.\n- I didn’t have funding.\n\n\nStill, after months of trying and failing to teach myself to code...I gave up.\n\nBut a recently we found out we have a baby on the way. And that lit a fire under my ass to learn faster. So I sat down, found a vibecoding platform, and built this site last month.\n\nI got a janky MVP working and launched Vocablii, a tool that turns any YouTube video into a fully interactive vocab learning experience.\n\n- It pulls the transcript from the video\n\n- Highlights all the vocabulary in order of frequency\n\n- Translates words on hover\n\n- Lets you skip words you already know\n\n- Creates flashcards with SRS\n\n- I even added some mini-games for \"fun\" practice because I'm not doing the coding so why not.\n\n\nI thought maybe a few people would find it useful.\nThen I made this Reddit post in r/languagelearning.\n\nAnd straight up overnight I had 150+ users registered users.\nEnglish teachers started reaching out.\n I had to (vibe) rewrite huge parts of the code due to feedback from real learners.\nAnd now I've had to upgrade my API subscriptions due to the traffic. \n\nAll from a single Reddit post that validated the idea.\n\n\nSo...here’s what worked...\n\n1. I built something I actually needed.\nI wasn’t trying to build a business. I was trying to solve my own problem. That made things easy. I literally thought, what would be perfect for ME, and made that. Turns out even though I'm 1-in-a-million that means there's ~8,000 people just like me\n\n2. I told the full story.\nThe job loss, the bilingual household, the new baby - people on the subreddit understood that, they related to it, they reached out and personal messages and gave their support ...I think they wanted me to win because I wasn't some faceless corporation but just some dude on reddit struggling.\n\n3. I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed. I was literally sitting in the airport terminal adding new features and fixing bugs in real time waiting for my flight that night (vietjet delayed 3 hours so I got a lot done)\n\n\nIt’s not perfect.\nIt doesn’t work with Netflix (yet).\nIt sometimes breaks with Japanese.\nBut it’s real, and it’s helping people.\nAnd it's actually growing...\nThat’s more than I ever expected.\n\nSo what I did to actually make money with vocabii, is\n\nThe site is free to try out with 1 video.\n\nAfter that is soft locks the user to register to make more flashcard decks.\n\nFree users get 5 free YouTube video to decks conversations per month.\n\nThere's 2 paid tiers\n\n1.99 for 20 decks a month + premium features \n\n4.99 for unlimited decks a month + premium features \n\n\nWhat I found has made a difference, is I check the support email every morning. I actually talk with my users like people. Some of them have sent in requests or bugs that I'll work on. But sometimes it's just a nice conversation.\n\nAnd if you're building your own thing (language-related or not), Reddit is seriously underrated. I mean, I've used this platform since 2012 now...it used to be better but it's still dang good as a community.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. I'm no expert on indiehacking but my little success story is something.\nHappy to share everything.",

And that lit a fire under my ass to learn faster. So I sat down, found a vibecoding platform, and built this site last month.\n\nI got a janky MVP working and launched Vocablii, a tool that turns any YouTube video into a fully interactive vocab learning experience.\n\nIt pulls the transcript from the video\n\nHighlights all the vocabulary in order of frequency\n\nTranslates words on hover\n\nLets you skip words you already know\n\nCreates flashcards with SRS\n\nI even added some mini-games for fun practice because I'm not doing the coding so why not.\n\n\nI thought maybe a few people would find it useful.\nThen I made this Reddit post in r/languagelearning.\n\nAnd straight up overnight I had 150+ users registered users.\nEnglish teachers started reaching out.\n I had to (vibe) rewrite huge parts of the code due to feedback from real learners.\nAnd now I've had to upgrade my API subscriptions due to the traffic. \n\nAll from a single Reddit post that validated the idea.\n\n\nSo...here’s what worked...\n\n1. I built something I actually needed.\nI wasn’t trying to build a business. I was trying to solve my own problem. That made things easy. I literally thought, what would be perfect for ME, and made that. Turns out even though I'm 1-in-a-million that means there's ~8,000 people just like me\n\n2. I told the full story.\nThe job loss, the bilingual household, the new baby - people on the subreddit understood that, they related to it, they reached out and personal messages and gave their support ...I think they wanted me to win because I wasn't some faceless corporation but just some dude on reddit struggling.\n\n3. I stayed in the comments.\nEvery single user issue became a feature. Users told me what was broken, what they loved, and what they wished existed. I was literally sitting in the airport terminal adding new features and fixing bugs in real time waiting for my flight that night (vietjet delayed 3 hours so I got a lot done)\n\n\nIt’s not perfect.\nIt doesn’t work with Netflix (yet).\nIt sometimes breaks with Japanese.\nBut it’s real, and it’s helping people.\nAnd it's actually growing...\nThat’s more than I ever expected.\n\nIf you're curious, the site is vocablii.com (shameless plug) free to try, freemium if you go deeper.\n\nAnd if you're building your own thing (language-related or not), Reddit is seriously underrated. I mean, I've used this platform since 2012 now...it used to be better but it's still dang good as a community.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. I'm no expert on indiehacking but my little success story is something.\nHappy to share everything.\n",
