        "selftext": "I run a small business and most days I’m proud of it. I built it from nothing, learned things the hard way, and I’ve managed to keep it alive longer than a lot of people told me it would last. I even have some money saved up from myprize, which still feels strange to say because for a long time everything went straight back into the business.  \nWhat I wasn’t prepared for is how isolating the decision making can feel.  \nEvery choice feels like it matters more than it probably does. Pricing, hiring help, saying no to a client, saying yes to the wrong one. There’s no manager to sanity check things, no team meeting where someone else shares the weight. It’s just me, my laptop, and a constant background question of am I doing this right.\n\nI’ll go back and forth for days over things that look small from the outside. Spend a little to save time or save the money and burn myself out. Play it safe or take a risk. Protect the cash I worked hard to build or reinvest and hope it pays off. Either way, if it goes wrong, it’s on me.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that people assume owning a business means freedom and confidence. So I don’t really talk about the doubt part. I nod along, say things are good, and keep the stress to myself. I don’t regret starting this at all. I just didn’t realize how much of the job is sitting quietly with uncertainty and still having to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m curious how other small business owners deal with that. Does the constant second guessing ever calm down, or do you just get better at carrying it without letting it take over everything.",

        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some honest perspective here.\n\nI recently joined a company of 200+ employees as a VP (strategy-focused role). The people are great, the values are strong, culture is good, and overall it feels like there’s a ton of potential.\n\nBut I’ve been kind of shocked by how the executive team actually operates day to day.\n\nMost of the leadership time seems to go into very operational stuff. Weekly meetings are basically project-by-project check-ins, super granular. Monthly meetings are mostly just reporting on last month’s results. Like…this meeting could have been an email kind of vibe. And in the last three months, I honestly haven’t seen a real strategic conversation… like working on the business instead of just in it.\n\nWhat also throws me off is how unprepared a lot of these meetings feel. No agenda, no pre-read, no notes, no follow-up. People show up and kind of wing it. It’s not toxic or anything, the vibe is friendly, but it feels… soft? Like this company could seriously level up if the exec layer was more structured and intentional.\n\nMy issue is: I’m new, and this isn’t technically “my job” to fix right now. I really don’t want to be the guy who walks in and starts criticizing everything or trying to change the culture overnight.\n\nBut at the same time, it feels like such a missed opportunity.\n\nSo I’m torn. Do I bring it up privately with the CEO? Do I just focus on modeling better structure in my own area first? Do I suggest an external consultant to come in and help with exec operating rhythm? Or do I accept that changing leadership culture is a massive uphill battle and not worth spending political capital on this early?\n\nCurious if anyone’s been in a similar situation. Would love any advice on how to approach this without coming off negative or naïve.\n\nThanks ❤️",

The \"customer\" sent the receipt to a lab for testing.\n\nThere’s a surge in **Prop 65 violation** notices and lawsuits targeting businesses that hand out paper receipts in CA. The trigger: Bisphenol S (BPS) was added to the Prop 65 list in Dec 2024, and even trace amounts in **thermal receipt paper** can now lead to liability.\n\nMany businesses don’t make or sell the paper—and some suppliers even claim it’s “BPS-free”—but plaintiffs are using more sensitive testing to find tiny amounts. There’s no safe harbor level yet, so even minimal BPS can trigger claims. **Penalties can be up to $2,500 per day per violation.**\n\nWhat to consider now:\n\n* Go paperless if you can\n* Switch to phenol-free receipt paper (**BPS and BPA** free) - I believe it has to be both but double check with your supplier.\n* Post a Prop 65 warning where receipts are issued (and on the receipt if possible)\n* If you get a notice, act immediately—there may be a short grace period if you fix it fast\n\nThis is hitting restaurants and retailers hard.

        "selftext": "I am a small business owner in Southern California and I am targeted by a predatory litigation mill. Looking for advice from anyone who has successfully fought back or been through similar situation\n\nBackground\n\nFirst Lawsuit  \nWe were sued by a predatory firm a few years ago. We settled, paid the fees, and hired a professional ADA company to fix every single item they identified. We have not changed the code or the site since that remediation was completed\n\nNew Claim  \nSame law firm is suing us again, but using a different \"plaintiff\"  \nPlaintiff's name shows up as a serial filer\n\nThe \"Service\"  \nThey didn't even serve me (yet?) An advertising firm emailed the complaint (no case number) to my boyfriend’s personal email address\n\nSite  \nOur website should be good. It scores 100 on Google Lighthouse and 0 Issues on axe DevTools. I even have a letter from a blind customer stating the site works perfectly for her\n\nWe are hanging by a thread. We’ve closed most of our locations and are sitting on $500k in EIDL debt from COVID. We literally have no cash to settle again\n\nOur lawyer is suggesting we just settle again to make it go away, but we don't have the money. I’ve told him we are \"judgment proof\" since the EIDL loan essentially means the government has first rights to our assets and we have no profit to take\n\nQuestions for the community\n\n1. Has anyone successfully used a prior settlement/remediation to get a second suit from the same firm thrown out?\n2. Since the EIDL loan is so high and the business is failing, has anyone successfully argued \"judgment proof\" to get these guys to stop wasting their time?\n\nI’m exhausted. It feels like it doesn't matter if your site is up to code, they just keep coming back. Any advice is appreciated\n\nFor all small business owners out there that have been through this and more, my heart goes out to you!",
