        "title": "I scraped 200k+ Reddit posts to find out the best way to get your first freelance client. Here is what I found:",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.\n\nSo, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of r/freelance, r/upwork, r/webdev, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.\n\nHere are the key findings from the data:\n\n* In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.\n* The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person > Cold Calling > DMs > Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.\n* Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.\n\nOverall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!\n\nMethodology & Data Constraints:\n\nWhile this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:\n\n* Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.\n* Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.\n* Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.\n* Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only \\~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.\n\nThe archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.\n\nFull data if you want to look at it yourself : [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?\n\n**EDIT:** Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe **bring in** several clients at once.\n\nAlso tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.\n\n**->** Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.",

He specifically wanted this textured raised ink effect which required puff printing and that added to the cost but he said no problem. I ordered all the blank hoodies, did the setup work, printed everything, shipped it all out in early December. He confirmed delivery and even sent me a photo saying they looked great.   \nThen last week I got notified by my payment processor that he filed a dispute claiming the quality wasn’t as described and he wants a full refund including the deposit.

        "title": "How I grew my SaaS to 50k+ ARR in a few months",
        "selftext": "Most SaaS founders think building the product is 70% of the work.\n\nI thought the same until I shipped my MVP and realized... it's actually the opposite. Building is maybe 30%. The other 70%? Getting people to actually use it.\n\nI'm a technical founder. I'd rather write code than cold DMs. But here's what I learned getting my[ SEO tool](https://blogseo.io) to $50k ARR ([proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/iROCSdxX)):\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nI messaged everyone I knew – ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, random people I'd met at events. But instead of pitching directly, I asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo things happen: If they're interested, they say \"yeah, me actually.\" If not, they might intro you to someone. You win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell.\n\n**2. Posting consistently (even with a small audience)**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing fancy. Just sharing what I was building and learning. Multiple people DM'd me asking about the product who became paying customers. The compounding effect is real, even if your posts only get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email (but targeting the right people)**\n\nThis didn't work great at first because my sequence sucked. But here's what I learned: spend 80% of your time on targeting the RIGHT people (nail your ICP), 20% on the copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly – much higher leverage.\n\n**4. SEO (the most underrated channel for SaaS)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks, pages started ranking and I got traffic from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most SaaS founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pulling from web content too. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of your potential customers.\n\nOne of my users reached 450+ clicks a day from organic search alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend ($200 each on Google + Meta)**\n\nOnly did this AFTER I had organic conversions. Ads amplify what's already working – they won't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't buy gave me their email. That list became valuable later.\n\n**6. Obsessing over first customers**\n\nTreated my first 10 customers like they were paying me $10k/month. Jumped on calls. Fixed bugs same-day. Asked for feedback constantly. Result? They became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies.\n\n**7. Affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. Made it dead simple to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = ongoing customer stream, not just one sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nLaunched on \"There's an AI for That\" – got a nice traffic spike. Lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug though (painful lesson: test your critical flows obsessively).\n\n**The honest truth about SaaS growth:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. These tactics aren't sexy. None of them went viral. But they compound.\n\nWhile everyone's chasing the next viral strategy, you can quietly stack Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders, it's SEO. Not because it's fast – it's not. But because it compounds. Every article you publish keeps working for you months (even years) later. And now with AI search pulling from web content, the surface area for discovery is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR. No fluff, just the stuff that actually moved the needle:\n\n👉 [15 High-Reward SEO Tactics I Used to Grow My Business to $50k ARR](https://www.notion.so/15-High-Reward-SEO-Tactics-I-Used-to-Grow-My-Business-to-50k-ARR-2d68871b675680c88878fa41f33cb0a6?source=copy_link)",

        "selftext": "I do a mix of photography and digital art, so my income is all over the place. Some months are stacked with shoots, edits, and commissions. Other months it’s quiet in a way that makes you question every life choice.  \nNow I'm treating the rainy day fund less like a savings goal and more like part of the workflow.  \nWhen a payment comes in, I move a small percentage out immediately, even if it feels almost pointless on slower months. On good months, I don’t get aggressive or try to “catch up,” I just keep the same rule and let the volume do the work. That way I’m not making emotional decisions based on how busy I feel that week.  \nI also stopped framing it as money I’m not allowed to touch. It’s there for exactly the stuff that always happens as a freelancer. A client pushing a payment. A camera repair. A dry couple of weeks. If I dip into it, the only rule is that I slowly rebuild it once things pick back up, no guilt spiral attached. It’s still imperfect, but it’s the first system that doesn’t fall apart the second my schedule does. For context, I keep the rainy day money in the same place my freelance income lands. I use karat, but the main thing is just keeping it out of my personal spending flow.\n\nWould love to hear how other freelancers here handle their rainy day fund, especially if your work swings between creative and digital like mine.",
