        "selftext": "Back in 1998, three German brothers: Marc, Oliver, and Alexander noticed something interesting: eBay was exploding in the US, but hadn‚Äôt yet touched Germany.\n\nThey pitched eBay directly:¬†*‚ÄúBring your platform here, and let us run it.‚Äù*  \neBay said no.\n\nSo the Samwers went home, cloned eBay almost pixel for pixel, called it¬†**Alando**, and launched it in Germany. Within¬†**100 days**, eBay realized it was losing the market, and ended up acquiring Alando for¬†**$43M**.\n\nThat deal lit a fire. The brothers went on to found¬†**Rocket Internet**, a venture studio dedicated to a simple playbook: find a proven US startup, rebuild it for Europe or emerging markets, scale it fast, then sell it back (or compete directly). They cloned Facebook (StudiVZ), Airbnb (Wimdu), Groupon (Citydeal), and even Amazon (Zalando started as a Zappos copy).\n\nWhether you see it as genius or shady, it worked today each brother is worth around¬†**$1.2B**.\n\n**My takeaway:**\n\n* You don‚Äôt always need to invent something new. You can¬†*localize*¬†what already works elsewhere.\n* Speed and execution often beat originality. Rocket wasn‚Äôt first; they were just the fastest in their market.\n* Distribution can matter more than innovation. Even the best product loses if it doesn‚Äôt show up where users are.\n\nDo you think cloning US SaaS products for Europe still works, or are most tools global enough now that just translating the interface is all you need?",

        "title": "6 Years to Build, 6 Months to Collapse - My Rant",
        "selftext": "  \nWe opened our brick-and-mortar shop in Florida about six years ago with a simple idea: create a small slice of Europe here in the U.S. We hand-select unique goods from countries like Portugal, Spain, France and Italy, and we‚Äôve worked hard to build a store that feels different, an experience, not just a shop.\n\nWith the exception of our first year, we‚Äôve grown 10‚Äì13% year over year. We‚Äôve spent countless hours curating products, learning international logistics, and figuring out how to import legally and efficiently. When we brought in containers, we paid all duties and taxes. For smaller shipments, the¬†*de minimis*¬†exception helped balance the books, letting us absorb the steep HTS rates on bigger imports. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it's been working.\n\nOur plan was long-term,¬† keep building until 2028, then decide to either sell the business or lease it. Instead, in the past six months everything has started unraveling. With the new tariffs in place, invoices from DHL and UPS are suddenly showing 30‚Äì75% duties on the entire purchase cost.\n\nThat kind of increase isn‚Äôt just a line item, it‚Äôs a death sentence for businesses like ours. We don‚Äôt sell ‚Äúneeds,‚Äù we sell ‚Äúwants.‚Äù Our shop is essentially an upscale gift store. Raise prices enough and customers simply stop buying. And with the economy already tightening and consumer spend way down the timing couldn‚Äôt be worse. We‚Äôve just had the lowest sales months since opening.\n\nHere‚Äôs the bigger problem,¬† this isn‚Äôt just my shop. Thousands of small businesses like ours rely on imports to bring cultural, artisan, and specialty products to U.S. customers. These aren‚Äôt luxury yachts or mass-manufactured electronics. We‚Äôre talking about olive oil, ceramics, linens, crafts, wines, the things that connect communities here to cultures abroad. If these products become too expensive to import, entire categories of small retailers will vanish.\n\nMeanwhile, large corporations with global supply chains will find workarounds. They can eat losses, spread costs, and negotiate deals. But independents like us can‚Äôt. We built something that took six years to establish, and it feels like it could collapse in six months, not because of bad business decisions, but because of sweeping policy changes that don‚Äôt distinguish between Walmart and a family shop.\n\nI don‚Äôt even know how to sell a business whose entire model is now in jeopardy. If importing becomes impossible, the value of everything we‚Äôve built goes to zero.\n\nFor all the talk of supporting small businesses, this is the reality. Policies like this don‚Äôt just hit countries on the other side of the tariff, they hit the small American businesses on Main Street even harder.",

        "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, but here‚Äôs the short version:\n\nI‚Äôm a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets ‚Ä¶ including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos‚Äî the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed ‚Ä¶ until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this ‚Äî because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we‚Äôre agreeable, fast, and ‚Äúteam players.‚Äù\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries ‚Äî suddenly we‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to work with.‚Äù\n\nWell, I‚Äôve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI‚Äôm not sharing this for revenge.\nI‚Äôm sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We‚Äôre expected to deliver premium work ‚Äî and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they‚Äôre counting on. And it‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm no longer offering.\n\nI‚Äôm still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same ‚Äî you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for ‚Äî or paid for. \n\n‚Ä¶.\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay ‚Ä¶ ( deflection then silence ‚Äî even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They‚Äôre running Facebook ads using my work ‚Äî creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they‚Äôre commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It‚Äôs not right. \n\nAgain, If you‚Äôre doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don‚Äôt assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system ‚Äî it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it‚Äôs like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I‚Äôll start soon ‚Äî until it‚Äôs too late.\n\nHas anyone been through this? How do you break out of it?\nI don‚Äôt want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.\nAny systems? Habits? Mindset shifts? I‚Äôm open to anything.",

        "selftext": "I hate admitting I need help, but I am desperate. I am a 32 y/o female who is physically disabled due to multiple botched kyphoscoliosis surgeries. I deal with pain unless I sit in a reclined/lying down position due to the curves in my spine. I could probably swing about 2.5-3 hours of \"on my feet\" time to build a business each day. I'm mentally well and crave mental stimulation, a job, my own money, and my own autonomy. I have applied to hundreds of remote jobs, but I lack a work history due to my medical history. Before AI became popular, I was doing okay as a freelance copyeditor and content writer; I had just graduated from a Master of Liberal Arts program with a 4.0, was halfway through a respected copyediting certificate program, had six regular clients, and was feeling confident in myself. Those clients disappeared over the course of a couple of months. I tried for months to land more clients, but the market became intensely competitive; plenty of folks with much more experience than me also needed to work and were lowering their rates. I have spun my wheels since. I want to build my own business, but I'm stuck on figuring out what to do that will allow me to work largely from my laptop and what that business would be. My skills like research, writing, and editing have been replaced by AI. I am absolutely willing to learn, but I don't even know where to begin. I'm asking you guys to help me brainstorm some genuinely *plausible* ideas. There is so much noise online about making money that I don't know what ideas would work well going into 2026. Like I said, I'm willing to learn, and I don't expect easy, fast money. But if you were in my shoes, what ideas would you be exploring? Thank you Reddit. ",
