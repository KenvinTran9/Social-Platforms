        "selftext": "When I first got into the private jet business (no, I don’t own a jet), I thought I’d be selling these private jet flights to celebrities, billionaires, CEO’s etc. What I didn’t expect was the surging client base of Gen-Z’s, influencers, online gurus and dropshipping coaches. \n\nThe funny thing is that most of these people don’t even care about getting from A to B, most of them book the shortest route and some of them don’t even leave the ground… they just want pictures, and videos of them on the jet sipping champagne lol\n\nAt first this was extremely weird and I “judged” these people. Like why would they spend money just to flex on Instagram? It felt fake, very shallow. \n\nBut over time i realized that this was the product. The private jet is what people REALLY want. But they aren’t buying transportation, they are buying an image, a story of showing everyone “I made it” for most of them, painting this picture is more valuable than the jet itself. \n\nThe crazy is the absurdly MASSIVE demand for these fairly cheap private jet flights. I never imagined an entire market of people who aren’t rich but desperately want to LOOK rich. \n\nBut honestly, this was the best thing that could have happened to me because I don’t have to convince anyone to buy. The product (which is the jet flight) sells itself and I close those deals with little to no effort. \n\nThe lesson: sales isn’t always about the product you’re selling. It’s more about selling the feeling behind it and getting people emotionally invested. If you understand ego, you’ll understand markets. \n\n ",

I went above and beyond what was in the scope of work simply because it's a small town and I didnt mind. \n\nAnyway. We wrapped everything up and it was time to pay. I sent the wrap-up email on Tuesday, August 14th. I did not hear from the client for SIX days. She responded to me on August 19th and paid me $750. She said that she'd pay me the remaining $500 on Monday, which would have been August 25th. \n\nWell, Monday came and went and I didn't hear from her. I am not starving so I gave her some extra time... I finally decided to reach out to her on Friday, September 5th, which is an additional 12 days of time that I gave her. She did not even respond to me but continued to actively promote her business on social media. \n\nI reached out to her again on September 14th after waiting another eight days. She messaged me back immediately this time except she didn't acknowledge her lack of communication or my request for payment and instead asked a technical question. I replied reiterating that I needed payment at this point. Screenshots are attached. My friend said I was rude but I don't feel like I was rude, just direct. I was more than patient with her while waiting for payment and the fact that she didn't even bother communicating with me after missing the payment date that SHE set really irked me. Did I handle this appropriately? Any advice for next time? \n\nThank you. ",

        "title": "Your Brain is Why Your Startup Will Probably Fail",
        "selftext": "After building MVPs for more than 30 founders, I can tell you the biggest reason startups die has nothing to do with the product, the market, or the competition. It's because your brain isn't built for the soul crushing boredom of actually growing a business.\n\nYou're addicted to the idea of success, not the reality of it. Reading stories about million-dollar exits gives you a quick rush, a hit of excitement. The problem is, the actual day to day work of building a Startup gives you none of that. It's slow, tedious, and feels like you're going nowhere for the first year or two. Your brain interprets that lack of excitement as failure.\n\nFounders have a picture in their head of what being a founder looks like. They think they'll be a visionary, making big strategic moves. The reality? You spend most of your time doing things you're not good at and don't enjoy, like answering the same support ticket for the tenth time or begging for a demo. Your ego takes a beating, and most people can't handle that for long.\n\nOur brains are wired to want rewards now. Getting one new user today feels way better than doing the slow, boring work that might get you a hundred users six months from now. This is why founders waste time on redesigning their logo or chasing press instead of doing the unglamorous work of talking to customers one on one. They're looking for a quick feel good hit.\n\nEveryone preaches about product market fit, but the real fit you need to find is between your psychological makeup and the reality of running a business that grows 2% month over month for three years straight. Most people's brains literally can't handle that level of delayed gratification without external validation.\n\nThe Startup game isn't a test of how smart you are. It's a test of your patience. The founders who win are the ones who can mentally handle showing up every day for two years straight while it feels like nothing is happening. They win the battle against their own brain's need for constant excitement.\n\nWhat was the biggest mental trick you had to play on yourself to keep going when things were painfully slow?",

I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result.

        "selftext": "Many freelancers struggle to keep clients and get referrals. There are four simple rules I adhere to:\n\n1. Always overdeliver. Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more.\n2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust.\n3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline.\n4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking \"how is the project going?\" you’re already behind.\n\nOnce a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others. That's the start of a snowball effect.\n\n",
