Hopefully this helps anyone starting a new software project.\n\n# 1. Product matters, but acquisition matters more\n\nFeatures are great, but none of them matter if no one sees them. In the early days you have zero credibility, zero trust, and very limited data. So the acquisition channel becomes the real lifeline.\n\nIn week one after launch, we tested multiple paid channels:\n\n* Reddit ads\n* YouTube ads\n* Google Ads\n* Facebook ads\n\nWe didn’t have enough time to get deep data, but early signals showed Facebook gave us the best CAC. After that we shifted around **75 percent** of our focus to Facebook and Instagram.\n\n# 2. Video ads are stronger and cheaper\n\nVideo gives you more room to explain and visually hook people. Static images and text ads just can’t compete.\n\nWe created several videos:\n\n* 1 for retargeting only\n* 3 for sales campaigns\n\nThe retargeting video performed best because it was highly targeted based on onboarding events we track on our website.\n\n**Tip:** Never skip retargeting. Track your user journey well so you can target the people with the highest intent.\n\n# 3. Time to value changes everything\n\nAt first we opened a free trial. Users would sign up, run a search, and wait **3 to 7 minutes** for scraping and enrichment because we scrape more than 20 sites live. That delay killed momentum and slowed down the value moment.\n\nSo we changed the onboarding flow completely:\n\n* Removed free trial\n* Added a **10 second demo search** during signup\n* Show users 3 sample leads with basic info\n* To view emails they upgrade\n\nThis instantly improved the decision-making flow.  \nPeople who are interested upgrade quickly.  \nPeople who aren’t move on without draining our resources.\n\nThis single change increased conversions from ads by **around 160 percent** in the last 15 days.\n\n# 4. Personalized transactional emails helped too\n\nAfter a user runs a search, we detect what they sell and who they target. We then send AI generated tips to help them find better leads in their niche, along with a clear CTA to subscribe.\n\nThis also improved conversions, and we’re turning it into a full follow up system soon.   \n  \nthat's it, if you've any questions or need help just DM me or drop a comment.\n\nOur software: [Pyrsonalize.com](http://Pyrsonalize.com)",

([Proof](https://imgur.com/a/0vx2vHM))\n\nHere's what actually moved the needle.\n\n**Why most content fails**\n\nIt's not because it's bad. It's misplaced.\n\nYou're writing top-of-funnel content when your audience is ready to buy. Or bottom-of-funnel content for people who don't know they have a problem yet.\n\nThe fix: match content to buyer intent, not some arbitrary content calendar.\n\n**Site architecture matters more than you think**\n\nGoogle can't rank what it can't crawl.\n\n* Keep everything within 3 clicks from homepage. Buried pages get treated as low priority.\n* Fix orphan pages. Pages with 0 internal links are invisible to Google.\n* Use hub and spoke for topic clusters. One pillar page linking to 8-12 supporting articles, all linking back.\n* Make category pages rank, not just navigate. 800+ words of unique content, not just a list of links.\n\n**Internal linking that works**\n\nTOFU pages → MOFU pages → BOFU pages. Reverse linking hurts conversions. Most sites get this backwards.\n\n**The content quality shift**\n\nGoogle's algorithm isn't 2005 anymore. Bounce rate and engagement matter as much as backlinks. If people leave after 10 seconds, you won't rank no matter how many keywords you cram in.\n\n**Quick wins for today**\n\n1. Run a site crawl and fix orphan pages\n2. Check your robots.txt isn't blocking important pages\n3. Add your sitemap to Search Console & Bing Webmaster tool\n4. Find keywords your competitors rank for that you don't\n\nI broke down the [8 acquisition methods I used to hit $1K MRR](https://vince.beehiiv.com/p/the-8-actionable-user-acquisition-methods-to-hit-1k-mrr) (SEO being one of them) if you want the full playbook.\n\nCheers!",
